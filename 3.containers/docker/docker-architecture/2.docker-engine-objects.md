## 🧱 1. Docker Image

Think of an **image** like a **blueprint or recipe** for a container.

- It’s a **read-only template** that contains everything your app needs:

  - The base OS (like Ubuntu or Alpine)
  - App code
  - Dependencies (Python, .NET, Node.js, etc.)
  - Configuration (environment, commands)

When you run:

```bash
docker run nginx
```

Docker:

1. Downloads the **nginx image** from Docker Hub (if not already present).
2. Uses it as a **template** to create a container.

🧠 Images are **built from layers**. Each command in a Dockerfile adds a new layer:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
COPY app/ /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app/main.py"]
```

Each `FROM`, `COPY`, and `RUN` creates a layer — so rebuilding is fast and storage efficient.

## 📦 2. Docker Container

A **container** is a **running instance of an image**.

- It’s **read/write** (unlike images).
- When you start a container, Docker adds a **thin writable layer** on top of the image’s read-only layers.
- You can run, stop, or delete containers anytime.

Example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

This starts a **container** from the **nginx image**, mapping:

- Port 80 in container → Port 8080 on your machine.

When you delete the container, the writable layer is gone — the **image** remains unchanged.

🧠 Think:

> Image = class
> Container = object (instance of that class)

---

## 🌐 3. Docker Network

Containers need a way to talk to each other or to the outside world.
That’s where **Docker Networks** come in.

There are 3 common types:

| Network Type | Description                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bridge**   | Default network; containers on same host can talk by name |
| **host**     | Shares host’s network stack (no isolation)                |
| **none**     | No network at all (fully isolated)                        |

Example:

```bash
docker network create myapp-net
docker run -d --name web --network myapp-net nginx
docker run -d --name db --network myapp-net mysql
```

Now `web` can reach `db` by name (`db:3306`).

🧠 Think:

> Network = “Virtual switch” connecting containers together.

---

## 💾 4. Docker Volume

Containers are **temporary** — when you delete one, its data is gone.
To keep data safe, Docker uses **volumes**.

A **volume** is a **special directory** stored outside the container’s filesystem.

You can share it between containers or persist it even after a container is deleted.

Example:

```bash
docker volume create mydata
docker run -v mydata:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

Even if the MySQL container is removed, your database data in `mydata` still exists.

🧠 Think:

> Volume = Hard drive for your containers.

---

## 🏪 5. Docker Registry

A **registry** is where Docker stores and shares images.

- Public registry: **Docker Hub** (`hub.docker.com`)
- Private registries: AWS ECR, Azure ACR, Google GCR, Harbor, etc.

When you:

```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```

Docker downloads the image from the **registry** to your machine.
When you:

```bash
docker push myapp:latest
```

Docker uploads your image to a **registry** so others can use it.

🧠 Think:

> Registry = “App Store” for Docker images.
