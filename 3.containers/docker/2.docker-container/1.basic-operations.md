# Docker Containers

## Container - List the containers details

```bash
# List all containers
docker container ls

# List all containers, including stopped containers
docker container ls -a

# List all containers, including stopped containers, and show additional details
docker container ls -l

# List only the container IDs
docker container ls -q
```

```bash
# Create a new container
docker container create --name <container-name> <image-name>

# Start a stopped container
docker container start <container-id>

# Run a new container = create + start
docker container run --name <container-name> <image-name>

# Stop a running container
docker container stop <container-id>

# Remove a stopped container
docker container rm <container-id>
```

### why container exist immediately after running `docker container run`

Great question, Hady — this behavior often confuses people at first. Here's the simple explanation:

---

## 🐳 Why Docker Container Exits Immediately After `docker run`

### 🔍 Reason

A container runs a **main process** (like a script or command). If that process finishes or crashes, the container **exits**.

So when you run:

```bash
docker container run ubuntu
```

You're starting an Ubuntu container, but **no command is given** — it runs and exits instantly because there's nothing to do.

---

### ✅ Fix: Run an Interactive Shell

To keep the container alive, you need to run a long-lived process like a shell:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

This does two things:

- `-it` → interactive terminal
- `bash` → runs the Bash shell inside the container

Now the container stays alive as long as the shell is running.

---

### 🧠 Analogy

Think of a container like a **wrapper around a single command**.  
If the command is short (like `echo hello`), the container finishes and exits.  
If the command is long-lived (like `bash` or a web server), the container stays alive.
