# 🧊 Docker Container Control Commands: Use Case Comparison

| Command          | What It Does                           | Real-World Use Case                                                              | Beginner Analogy                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker pause`   | Freezes all processes (no CPU/network) | 🧪 You’re debugging a container and want to freeze its state without stopping it | ⏸️ Pause a movie — it stays loaded, just not playing |
| `docker unpause` | Resumes paused container               | 🔄 Resume after inspection or resource reallocation                              | ▶️ Press play again — movie continues                |
| `docker stop`    | Gracefully shuts down main process     | 🧼 You’re done with a dev container and want to shut it down cleanly             | 📴 Power off your laptop — safe shutdown             |
| `docker kill`    | Immediately terminates main process    | 🚨 A container is stuck or misbehaving — you need to force-stop it               | 🔌 Pull the plug — instant termination               |

## 🧠 Beginner-Friendly Scenarios

### 1. **Pause for Debugging**

```bash
docker pause myapp
```

- You’re inspecting logs or memory usage.
- You don’t want the app to keep running while you check.

### 2. **Stop for Cleanup**

```bash
docker stop myapp
```

- You finished testing a web server.
- You want to shut it down without losing data.

### 3. **Kill for Emergency**

```bash
docker kill myapp
```

- The container is stuck in a loop.
- It’s hogging CPU or memory.
- You need it gone — now.
