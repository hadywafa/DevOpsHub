# 🔐 Terraform State Locking Explained (Local & Remote)

## 🧰 Part 1: Default Locking in Local State (Same Machine)

### ✅ Default Behavior (Local Backend)

By default, when you use Terraform without a remote backend (i.e., the **local backend**), it stores the state in:

```bash
terraform.tfstate
```

But to **prevent accidental concurrent access**, Terraform uses a temporary lock file **locally**:

```bash
.terraform.tfstate.lock.info
```

### 🧠 What Happens?

When you run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`:

1. Terraform creates this file:

   ```ini
   .terraform.tfstate.lock.info
   ```

2. It blocks **other processes on the same machine** from modifying the state while the operation is running.

3. Once `apply` completes or fails, the lock file is removed.

---

### 🧪 Local Lock Example

✅ First shell:

```bash
terraform apply
```

🚫 Second shell (same machine, while first is still running):

```bash
Error: Error acquiring the state lock
```

Terraform won’t allow it because of the `.terraform.tfstate.lock.info` lock file.

---

### ⚠️ Limitation of Local Lock

- This lock is **only valid locally**.
- If **two users on different machines** access the same repo with Git (and local state), **there's no locking**.
- So, Terraform can get corrupted if:

  - Two people run `apply` at the same time
  - One is using stale state
  - You push/pull different `.tfstate` versions

---

## 🏗️ Part 2: Remote Locking with DynamoDB (for Remote S3 State)

Now let’s look at **real** multi-user state safety: **Remote Locking** using **S3 + DynamoDB**.

---

### ✅ What Is It?

When using the `backend "s3"` configuration **with `dynamodb_table`**, Terraform automatically enables **distributed state locking**.

---

### 🔄 What Happens Behind the Scenes?

When you run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` with remote state configured:

1. **Lock request sent to DynamoDB**

   - Terraform checks if a lock exists for that state file (by key, like `dev/terraform.tfstate`).

2. If **no lock exists**, DynamoDB inserts a lock item like:

   ```json
   {
     "LockID": "dev/terraform.tfstate",
     "Info": "operation=apply, user=lucy@example.com, time=2025-07-22..."
   }
   ```

3. Your Terraform process proceeds.

4. Once done, Terraform **deletes the lock item** from DynamoDB.

---

### 💥 What if Someone Else Tries to Apply During Lock?

They'll see:

```bash
╷
│ Error: Error acquiring the state lock
│
│ Error message: ConditionalCheckFailedException: The conditional request failed
╵
```

Terraform is **safely blocking** them — just like a mutex or semaphore in programming.

## 🧪 Real-Life Scenario

| User  | Action                             | Lock Behavior               |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Dev A | Runs `terraform apply`             | Lock is created in DynamoDB |
| Dev B | Runs `terraform plan` during apply | Fails: lock already exists  |
| Dev A | Apply finishes                     | Lock is released            |
| Dev B | Plan succeeds                      | Now allowed to read state   |

### 💡 Lock Entry in DynamoDB (Example)

| Attribute            | Value                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `LockID`             | `dev/terraform.tfstate`                 |
| `Info`               | JSON blob of operation info             |
| `Expires` (optional) | If enabled, can auto-expire stuck locks |

---

### 📜 Minimal Terraform Backend Config with Locking

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-tf-state-bucket"
    key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

---

### 🔒 DynamoDB Table Schema

```hcl
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "tf_lock" {
  name         = "terraform-locks"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "TerraformLocking"
  }
}
```

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature         | Local Backend Locking          | Remote Backend Locking (DynamoDB) |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Lock location   | `.terraform.tfstate.lock.info` | DynamoDB item with LockID         |
| Scope           | Local machine only             | Global (multi-user, distributed)  |
| Collision safe? | ❌ Only within local shell     | ✅ Across teams and machines      |
| Use case        | Solo developer                 | Teams, CI/CD, remote automation   |
| Setup effort    | None                           | S3 + DynamoDB backend setup       |
