# 🛠️ Terraform Import — Make Terraform Manage Existing Resources

## 🤔 What Is `terraform import`?

Terraform is primarily **declarative** — it wants to **create** infrastructure based on your `.tf` files. But sometimes, you already have resources created **outside of Terraform** — and you want Terraform to manage them **without recreating** them.

That’s where `terraform import` comes in:

> 💡 It adds an existing resource into your Terraform **state file**, so Terraform _thinks_ it created it — even though it didn’t.

---

## 📦 Typical Use Cases

- You created resources manually in AWS Console or CLI and want to migrate to Terraform.
- You're managing infra with multiple tools and consolidating into Terraform.
- You lost `.tf` code but still have a valid state file (partial recovery).

---

## 🧪 Real-Life Example: Import an EC2 Instance

Let’s say you have an EC2 instance already running in AWS with ID: `i-0123456789abcdef0`

You want to manage it using Terraform under:

```ini
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  # (we'll fill this in later!)
}
```

### Step 1: Write Empty Resource Block

Create a file `main.tf`:

```ini
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  # We'll fill this in AFTER importing
}
```

### Step 2: Import the Resource

```bash
terraform import aws_instance.my_ec2 i-0123456789abcdef0
```

📌 Syntax:

```ini
terraform import <resource_address> <resource_id>
```

Output:

```ini
aws_instance.my_ec2: Importing from ID "i-0123456789abcdef0"...
aws_instance.my_ec2: Import prepared!
  Prepared aws_instance for import
aws_instance.my_ec2: Refreshing state... [id=i-0123456789abcdef0]
Import successful!
```

This creates an entry in the `.tfstate` file — **but doesn’t fill in your `main.tf` yet**.

---

## 🧠 What Terraform Import _Doesn't_ Do

- ❌ It **doesn’t** update or generate `.tf` code
- ❌ It **doesn’t** download metadata as `.tf` blocks
- ✅ It **only adds** the resource to your **state file**

---

## 🧾 What to Do _After_ Importing

Now that the resource is imported, you need to **describe the resource fully in your `.tf` file**.

Otherwise, `terraform plan` may show the resource will be **destroyed and recreated** because of drift.

---

### Step 3: Inspect the Imported Resource

#### Option 1: `terraform show -json` + `jq`

```bash
terraform show -json | jq '.values.root_module.resources[] | select(.type == "aws_instance" and .name == "my_ec2")'
```

This will dump all known attributes that you must copy to your `.tf` config.

#### Option 2: Use AWS CLI

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0 \
  --query "Reservations[].Instances[].{AMI:ImageId,Type:InstanceType,Tags:Tags}"
```

---

### Step 4: Fill in the `.tf` Block

```ini
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my-key"

  tags = {
    Name = "my-ec2"
  }
}
```

⚠️ Make sure all attributes **match** the actual state. Otherwise, `terraform plan` will try to replace the resource.

---

## ✅ Check Everything Is In Sync

```bash
terraform plan
```

You should see:

```ini
No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.
```

🎉 Now Terraform is managing your imported resource safely!

---

## 🔄 Unimport / Remove from State

If you mess up, you can clean up with:

```bash
terraform state rm aws_instance.my_ec2
```

This removes the mapping from the state file without deleting the resource.

## 💡 Best Practices

| ✅ Do This                                       | ❌ Avoid This                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Match `.tf` to real resource exactly             | Leaving `.tf` empty                    |
| Use `terraform show -json` or AWS CLI to inspect | Guessing values                        |
| Run `terraform plan` immediately after import    | Running `apply` blindly                |
| Use version control (git) before/after import    | Editing `.tfstate` manually            |
| Remove `import`ed resources from state if unsure | Importing in production without backup |

## 🧪 Bonus: Script to Auto-Extract JSON for Import Debug

```bash
terraform show -json | jq '.values.root_module.resources[] | select(.address == "aws_instance.my_ec2")'
```

You can even write tools to convert this to HCL using AI or plugins.

| Step | Action                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1️⃣   | Create empty `.tf` resource                                  |
| 2️⃣   | Run `terraform import resource_name resource_id`             |
| 3️⃣   | Use `terraform show -json` or cloud CLI to inspect the state |
| 4️⃣   | Fill in `.tf` file with matching attributes                  |
| 5️⃣   | Run `terraform plan` and confirm all is synced               |
| 6️⃣   | Run `apply` ONLY when you're sure nothing breaks             |
