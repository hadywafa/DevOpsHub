# 🔁 Terraform Resource Update Behavior

## 🧠 How Terraform Handles Resource Updates

When you change something in your `.tf` file, Terraform evaluates whether the change can be **applied in-place**, or if it requires **replacement**.

Terraform has **three types of update behavior**:

### 1. ✅ In-place Update (`~`)

- Minor change — like updating the file **content** or tag
- Terraform just updates the resource directly
- No destroy/recreate needed

> Symbol in `terraform plan`: `~`

---

### 2. 🔁 Replace Resource (`-/+`)

- Major change — like changing **immutable fields** such as **file permissions** or **disk type**
- Terraform **destroys** the old resource and **recreates** a new one
- Tracked as **delete + create**

> Symbol in `terraform plan`: `-/+`
> Example: `file_permission = "0777" -> "0700"` (file needs to be recreated)

---

### 3. 💣 Destroy Only (`-`)

- Happens during `terraform destroy`
- Deletes resource without recreating

> Symbol in `terraform plan`: `-`

---

## 🔎 How Terraform Decides?

Terraform compares:

1. The desired state (your updated `.tf` file)
2. The current state (`terraform.tfstate`)
3. The actual world (via `terraform refresh`)

Then it creates an execution plan:

- `~`: Modify only
- `-/+`: Replace
- `-`: Delete

## ✅ Now Let’s See It in Action — Real Example

### 📝 Step 1: Create Initial Resource

```hcl
# main.tf
resource "local_file" "pet" {
  filename             = "/root/pets.txt"
  content              = "We love pets!"
  file_permission      = "0777"
  directory_permission = "0777"
}
```

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Result: File `/root/pets.txt` created with 0777 permissions.

---

### ✏️ Step 2: Change Immutable Attribute (Triggers Replacement)

Update `file_permission`:

```hcl
file_permission = "0700"
```

---

### 📘 Run `terraform plan`

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 🔍 Expected Output:

```text
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  -/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.pet must be replaced
-/+ resource "local_file" "pet" {
      ~ file_permission = "0777" -> "0700" # forces replacement
      ~ id              = "abc123" -> (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
```

> 🧠 Terraform realized it **can't modify `file_permission` directly**, so it marks the file for replacement.

---

### 🚀 Run `terraform apply`

```bash
terraform apply
```

### ✅ Output:

```text
local_file.pet: Destroying... [id=abc123]
local_file.pet: Destruction complete after 0s
local_file.pet: Creating...
local_file.pet: Creation complete after 0s [id=def456]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```

> File is deleted, then recreated with new permission `0700`.

```bash
ls -l /root/pets.txt
# -rwx------ 1 root root 30 pets.txt
```

---

### 🧨 Step 3: Destroy the File

```bash
terraform destroy
```

### 🔥 Output:

```text
Terraform will perform the following actions:
  # local_file.pet will be destroyed

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Enter a value: yes

local_file.pet: Destroying... [id=def456]
local_file.pet: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

## 🧠 Summary of Update Behavior

| Change Example                        | Terraform Symbol | Behavior                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `content = "text A"` → `"text B"`     | `~`              | In-place update              |
| `file_permission = "0777"` → `"0700"` | `-/+`            | Replace (destroy & recreate) |
| `terraform destroy`                   | `-`              | Destroy only                 |
