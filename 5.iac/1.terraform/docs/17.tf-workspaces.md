# 🧭 Terraform Workspaces — Manage Multiple Environments

A **workspace** in Terraform is an isolated instance of Terraform **state data**. This means you can use **the same configuration files** to manage **different environments** (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) — each with its **own separate `terraform.tfstate`**.

---

## 🧱 Default Workspace

Terraform always starts with a workspace named `default`.

```bash
terraform workspace show
# output:
default
```

If you never create other workspaces, everything happens inside this `default`.

## 🎯 Why Use Workspaces?

| Use Case                    | Why It Helps                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 Manage dev/stage/prod    | Each environment has separate resources/state |
| 🧪 Safe experimentation     | Break nothing in prod while testing           |
| 👨‍💻 CI/CD pipelines          | Create dynamic, per-branch workspaces         |
| 🌐 Multi-region deployments | Separate infra per region in same repo        |

## ⚙️ Workspace Commands

| Command                             | Description                             |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `terraform workspace list`          | Show all available workspaces           |
| `terraform workspace show`          | Show current workspace                  |
| `terraform workspace new <name>`    | Create and switch to new workspace      |
| `terraform workspace select <name>` | Switch to an existing workspace         |
| `terraform workspace delete <name>` | Delete a workspace (must not be active) |

---

### 🛠️ Example Workflow

```bash
terraform workspace list
# * default

terraform workspace new dev
# Switched to workspace "dev".

terraform workspace new prod
# Switched to workspace "prod"

terraform workspace select dev
# Back to dev

terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Each workspace creates its own **terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace-name>/terraform.tfstate** file.

---

## 📂 Workspace-Specific State Files

After creating a new workspace, the directory structure looks like this:

```ini
terraform.tfstate.d/
├── dev/
│   └── terraform.tfstate
├── prod/
│   └── terraform.tfstate
```

---

## 🧩 How to Use Workspace Name in Code

Terraform exposes the current workspace name as a built-in variable:

```hcl
locals {
  env = terraform.workspace
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mybucket" {
  bucket = "mycompany-${local.env}-bucket"
}
```

> So `terraform.workspace` will be `dev`, `prod`, etc. automatically, depending on your current workspace.

## 🚨 Workspace Pitfalls & Gotchas

| Caution                            | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Not for full prod isolation     | Still shares the same backend (e.g., S3 bucket), use separate projects for strict separation |
| ⚠️ Easy to forget active workspace | Use `terraform workspace show` before running `apply`                                        |
| 🧪 Local-only by default           | Remote backends (e.g., S3) need explicit support for workspaces                              |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- 🧼 Use `terraform.workspace` in naming to separate resources
- 🛡️ Use different backends if environments must be strictly isolated (e.g., separate AWS accounts)
- 📦 Use modules to reduce duplicated config between environments
- 🔐 Be cautious with `workspace delete` — it wipes state

## 📘 Summary

| Feature                 | Value                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🔀 Multiple workspaces  | Manage isolated infrastructure using same code |
| 🎯 Uses state isolation | Each workspace gets its own `.tfstate`         |
| 📦 Variable in code     | Use `terraform.workspace` to adapt logic       |
| 🧠 Good for             | Dev/Test/Prod, CI/CD, regional deployments     |
| ⚠️ Not good for         | Security boundaries or compliance separation   |
