# 🧠 Terraform State Commands

> ✅ Use `terraform state` commands when you need to **inspect, modify, or recover** Terraform-managed infrastructure from the state file directly.

---

## 📦 What Is Terraform State?

- The `terraform.tfstate` file keeps track of the **actual deployed resources** and their **metadata**, so Terraform knows **what exists** and **what it manages**.
- Sometimes, you need to **query** or **manipulate** this state file — and that’s where `terraform state` commands come in.

---

## 🧰 Core `terraform state` Subcommands

### 🔍 1. `terraform state list`

> Lists all the resources tracked in the current state.

```bash
terraform state list
```

**Example Output:**

```ini
local_file.pet
aws_instance.web_server
module.vpc.aws_vpc.main
```

Use it to **find resource addresses** for editing, moving, or removing.

---

### 🧠 2. `terraform state show <address>`

> Shows detailed info about a resource **from the state**, not from cloud.

```bash
terraform state show aws_instance.web_server
```

**Output Example:**

```text
# aws_instance.web_server:
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ...
}
```

> Useful for **debugging**, checking current attributes, or viewing sensitive values.

---

### 🔀 3. `terraform state mv <source> <destination>`

> The `terraform state mv` command is all about **renaming or relocating resources inside Terraform's state file**, without touching the actual infrastructure in the cloud.

```bash
terraform state mv aws_instance.old aws_instance.new
```

**🔧 What It Really Does:**

- ✅ **Updates Terraform's internal tracking** to match your new code layout.
- ❌ Does **not** make any changes in AWS, Azure, or wherever your resources live.
- 🔒 Prevents Terraform from thinking it's a brand-new resource and triggering a destroy/create cycle.

**🔁 Think of It Like This:**

Imagine Terraform is managing a server called `aws_instance.old_name`. You rename it to `aws_instance.new_name` in your code.  
Without the `state mv` command, Terraform would say:

> “Hmm, I guess we need to **delete** the old one and **create** a new one!”

But with the command:

```bash
terraform state mv aws_instance.old_name aws_instance.new_name
```

Terraform now says:

> “Ah, same server—just a new label in the code. Got it. No changes needed!”

---

### ❌ 4. `terraform state rm <address>`

> Removes a resource **from Terraform’s state file**, but **not from the actual cloud**.

```bash
terraform state rm aws_s3_bucket.example
```

Use cases:

- Temporarily unmanaged resources
- Replacing/force recreating resources

> ⚠️ Be careful! Terraform will think the resource no longer exists and may try to recreate it later.

---

### ➕ 5. `terraform state add` _(rarely used)_

> Manually adds a resource into state — must provide JSON manually.  
> ⚠️ Mostly used by advanced users or for state recovery.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: State File Location Options

You can pass flags like:

```bash
terraform state list -state=custom.tfstate
```

Useful when working with **non-default or remote** state files.

---

## ⚠️ When Should You Use `terraform state` Commands?

✅ Yes:

- You renamed/moved a resource and want to **preserve state**
- You want to **inspect resource attributes** before updating
- You're **reorganizing modules**

❌ No:

- You’re unsure — state operations can **break** infra
- You want to make a change — instead, change the `.tf` file and `apply`

---

## 🔐 Best Practices

- Always **back up your state file** before using `terraform state`
- Avoid editing the state manually (use the commands, not a text editor)
- For teamwork: use **remote state backends** with locking (S3 + DynamoDB, etc.)
- Never commit secrets stored in state files to Git!

| Command                | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `terraform state list` | Show all tracked resources                      |
| `terraform state show` | Inspect a resource in the state                 |
| `terraform state mv`   | Rename/move a resource inside the state         |
| `terraform state rm`   | Remove resource from state (doesn’t destroy it) |
| `terraform state add`  | Add a resource manually to state (advanced)     |
