# 🌋 Terraform Provisioners: Creation, Destruction & Failure Behavior

## 🧠 What Are Provisioners?

Terraform provisioners allow you to **execute custom scripts or commands** on your **local machine** or **remote server** during:

- 🏗️ Resource **creation**
- 💣 Resource **destruction**

Provisioners break the declarative model of Terraform, so use them sparingly—mostly for:

✅ Bootstrapping  
✅ Logging  
❌ Not for production configuration

---

## 🔧 1. Creation-Time Provisioner (`local-exec`)

> Runs **after** the resource is successfully created.

### ✍️ Example

```ini
resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
  ami           = "ami-0edab43b6fa892279"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo Instance ${self.public_ip} Created! > /tmp/instance_created.txt"
  }
}
```

🗂️ **What this does**:
After the EC2 instance is created, Terraform runs the command **on your local machine** and saves the public IP to a file.

🧠 Tip: `${self}` refers to the current resource inside the provisioner block.

---

## 💣 2. Destroy-Time Provisioner (`when = destroy`)

> Executes the provisioner **before destroying** the resource.

### ✍️ Example

```ini
resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
  ami           = "ami-0edab43b6fa892279"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when    = destroy
    command = "echo Instance ${self.public_ip} is being destroyed! > /tmp/instance_destroyed.txt"
  }
}
```

🗂️ **What this does**:
Before the instance is terminated, Terraform logs its IP to a file.

⚠️ This runs **before** resource deletion, so the resource still exists when this executes.

---

## 💥 3. Handling Failures: `on_failure`

By default, if a provisioner fails, **Terraform will stop** the plan/apply process.

You can change this with:

- `on_failure = "fail"` (default – halt everything)
- `on_failure = "continue"` (log error but continue)

---

### ✍️ Example: `on_failure = "fail"`

```ini
provisioner "local-exec" {
  on_failure = "fail"
  command    = "exit 1" # Simulates a failure
}
```

🔴 **Result**: Terraform fails and stops execution.

---

### ✍️ Example: `on_failure = "continue"`

```ini
provisioner "local-exec" {
  on_failure = "continue"
  command    = "exit 1" # Simulates a failure
}
```

🟡 **Result**: Terraform logs the failure but continues applying other resources.

## 📸 Summary Table

| Provisioner Time | Trigger                  | Runs On         | Key Attribute      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Creation         | After resource creation  | Local or remote | `provisioner`      |
| Destruction      | Before resource deletion | Local or remote | `when = destroy`   |
| Failure Behavior | On command failure       | Local or remote | `on_failure = ...` |

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls

| Problem                        | Cause                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provisioner fails randomly     | Script depends on non-ready resource                      |
| Public IP not found in destroy | You must use `${self.public_ip}` not direct interpolation |
| Commands run too early         | Use `depends_on` if needed for ordering                   |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

| ✅ Do                       | ❌ Don’t                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Use for simple logging      | Use for real software provisioning |
| Log public IPs or metadata  | Configure web servers or databases |
| Use `on_failure = continue` | Depend on fragile commands         |

## 🔚 Wrap Up

Provisioners are **like duct tape** in Terraform—not elegant, but sometimes needed. Stick to:

- ✅ `user_data` for init scripts
- ✅ **Packer** for building AMIs
- ❌ Avoid provisioners in production pipelines
