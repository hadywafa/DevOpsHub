<details><summary>
3. What‚Äôs S3 bucket and what types of it?</summary><br><b>

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects.

    Types(storage classes):
    - S3 Standard: for frequently accessed data
    - S3 Intelligent-Tiering: for automatic cost savings for data with unknown or changing access patterns
    - S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) for less frequently accessed data,
    - S3 Glacier

<details><summary>
4. Is there a difference between SG and NACL?</summary><br><b>

Security groups are associated with an instance of a service. It can be associated with one or more security groups that have been created by the user. (Stateful)
A security group can be understood as a firewall to protect EC2 instances.
NACL can be understood as the firewall or protection for the subnet. (stateless)
</b></details>

---

<details><summary>
5. What‚Äôs the difference between Public Subnet and Private Subnet?</summary><br><b>

The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the internet.(Via Internet Gatway).
Whereas the instances in the private subnet can't. Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet.
</b></details>

---

<details><summary>
6. How can an application access Internet without receiving requests from the internet?</summary><br><b>

Using NAT configured in the Routing Table.
The database servers can connect to the internet for software updates using the NAT gateway, but the internet cannot establish connections to the database servers.

## Docker Questions:

<details><summary>
17. What‚Äôs the difference between container vs VM?</summary><br><b>

![image](https://github.com/Ahmed-Moourad/DevOps-Interview-Questions-for-Juniors/assets/112473376/e5eb4f75-82d4-4b39-8ac7-e5c5a428fb0d)

**VM**: uses separate OS for each VM

**Containers**:

- Use the Host OS
- Less utilization
- Your app is backed in a container and shared between environments: DEV, TEST, OPERATION
- Less size
- Fast boot up
  containers abstract application layer, vm abstract os

</b></details>

---

<details><summary>
18. What are Docker Image layers?</summary><br><b>

Layers are a result of the way Docker images are built. Each step in a Dockerfile creates a new ‚Äúlayer‚Äù that‚Äôs essentially a diff of the filesystem changes since the last step.
Metadata instructions such as LABEL and MAINTAINER do not create layers because they don‚Äôt affect the filesystem.

- Each layer is a snapshot of changes made to the filesystem.
- Layers are created from instructions in a Dockerfile (like RUN, COPY, ADD).
- The final image is a stack of these layers, combined to form a complete environment.

üß™ Example Breakdown

Let‚Äôs say your Dockerfile looks like this:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt update
RUN apt install -y python3
COPY . /app
CMD ["python3", "/app/app.py"]
```

This creates layers like:

- Base layer: Ubuntu OS
- Update layer: apt update
- Install layer: Python3 installed
- Copy layer: Your app files added
- Command layer: Default command to run
  Each layer is read-only and cached, so Docker can reuse them to speed up builds.

üîÑ Why Layers Matter

- üß† Efficiency: Docker reuses unchanged layers to avoid rebuilding everything.
- üì¶ Storage: Shared layers between images save disk space.
- üöÄ Speed: Faster builds and pulls, especially in CI/CD pipelines.

<details><summary>  
19. What‚Äôs the difference between Entrypoint and CMD?</summary><br>

| Instruction  | Purpose                                           | Overridable?             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `ENTRYPOINT` | Defines the **main executable** for the container | ‚ùå Not easily overridden |
| `CMD`        | Provides **default arguments** to ENTRYPOINT      | ‚úÖ Easily overridden     |

üß™ Example

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

- Running `docker run myimage` ‚Üí executes: `python3 app.py`
- Running `docker run myimage other_script.py` ‚Üí executes: `python3 other_script.py`

> So `ENTRYPOINT` locks in the command, while `CMD` sets defaults you can change at runtime.

</b></details>

---

<details><summary>
20. What are multiple base images on Dockerfile?</summary><br>

It allows you to create multiple image layers on top of the previous layers and the **AS** command provides a virtual name to the intermediate image layer. The last FROM command in the dockerfile creates the actual final image

- the idea that you have two images, the first one you build your binaries files and copy them to the second one, and the second image is the final image which from it you run your container. the first image helped you to build the second one.
- The benefits you get from this are that you built your app on a large image and the final result is a lightweight image that is on your containers.

---

It‚Äôs a way to use **multiple `FROM` instructions** in a single Dockerfile‚Äîeach one starts a new build stage with its own base image. This helps you:

- **Build** your app in one stage (e.g. using `golang`)
- **Package** it in a lightweight final image (e.g. using `alpine`)
- **Copy only what you need** from one stage to another

---

üß™ Example

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.16 AS build
ADD /src
WORKDIR /src
RUN go test --cover -v ./...
RUN go build -v -o demo

FROM alpine:3.4
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["demo"]
COPY --from=build /src/demo /usr/local/bin/demo
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/demo
```

üîç What‚Äôs Happening Here?

1. **Stage 1 (`build`)**:

   - Uses `golang:1.16` to compile the Go app.
   - It‚Äôs used **during the build process** to compile and test the Go app.
   - But it‚Äôs **excluded** from the final container image.
   - Runs tests and builds the binary `demo`.
   - So yes, it‚Äôs effectively ‚Äúdiscarded‚Äù‚ÄîDocker **doesn‚Äôt include the first stage** in the image that gets run.

2. **Stage 2 (final image)**:
   - Uses `alpine:3.4` for a minimal runtime.
   - Copies the compiled binary from the `build` stage.
   - Sets up the container to run `demo`.

> üí° That‚Äôs why multi-stage builds are so useful: they let you **compile with heavy tools** and then **deploy with a clean, lightweight runtime**.

<details><summary>
21. What are types of Docker volumes?</summary><br><b>

Docker volumes come in a few flavors, each suited to different use cases. Here's a quick breakdown to keep things simple and clear:

üì¶ Types of Docker Volumes

| Type                 | Description                                            | Use Case Example                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Named Volume**     | Managed by Docker, stored in `/var/lib/docker/volumes` | Persisting database data across restarts     |
| **Anonymous Volume** | Like named volumes but without a user-defined name     | Temporary storage for short-lived containers |
| **Bind Mount**       | Maps a specific host path into the container           | Live code editing during development         |
| **Tmpfs Mount**      | Stored in memory, not on disk                          | Sensitive data or caching during runtime     |
| **Volume Plugin**    | External storage via plugins (e.g. Amazon EBS, NFS)    | Shared storage across multiple hosts         |

### üß™ Examples

#### Named Volume

```bash
docker volume create mydata
docker run -v mydata:/app/data myimage
```

#### Anonymous Volume

```bash
docker run -v /app/data myimage
```

#### Bind Mount

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/app myimage
```

#### Tmpfs Mount

```bash
docker run --tmpfs /app/cache myimage
```

#### Volume Plugin

```bash
docker volume create --driver rexray myvolume
```

> üí° Each type has its strengths. For example, **bind mounts** are great for development, while **named volumes** shine in production.

<details><summary>
22. What are the types of Docker networks?</summary><br>

1. bridge
2. overlay
3. host
4. none
5. macvlan
6. ipvlan

---

### üåâ 1. **Bridge Network**

- **Default** for standalone containers.
- Containers get their own internal IP.
- You can expose ports using `-p` (e.g. `8080:80`).
- Great for local development and isolated setups.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è 2. **Host Network**

- Container shares the **host‚Äôs network stack**.
- No port mapping needed‚Äîcontainer uses host IP directly.
- Useful for performance or apps needing native network access.

---

### üö´ 3. **None Network**

- No networking at all.
- Container is completely isolated.
- Ideal for sandboxed tasks or enhanced security.

---

### üï∏Ô∏è 4. **Overlay Network**

- Connects containers across **multiple Docker hosts**.
- Used in **Docker Swarm** for distributed apps.
- Enables secure multi-host communication.

---

### üß¨ 5. **Macvlan Network**

- Container gets its own **MAC address** and IP on the LAN.
- Appears as a physical device on the network.
- Useful for legacy apps or network monitoring tools.

---

### üß™ 6. **IPvlan Network**

- Similar to Macvlan but uses host‚Äôs MAC address.
- Efficient for high-density environments.
- Offers fine-grained control over IP routing.

---

### üîç What We Mean by ‚ÄúBinding to Host IP‚Äù

There are **two perspectives** when we talk about containers binding to the host‚Äôs IP:

1. **Direct IP Binding (Native Networking)**  
   The container behaves like part of the host system, sharing the **host‚Äôs IP stack** without NAT or port mapping.

2. **Indirect Access via Port Publishing**  
   The container runs in isolation (e.g. on a bridge network), but we **map specific host ports to container ports**, allowing traffic through NAT.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è So What‚Äôs the Actual Difference?

| Network Type       | Directly Shares Host IP? | Port Mapping Needed?    | Container Gets Own IP? | Example Access                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Host**           | ‚úÖ Yes                   | ‚ùå Not required         | ‚ùå No                  | App listens directly on host IP:port |
| **Bridge**         | ‚ùå No                    | ‚úÖ Required             | ‚úÖ Yes                 | Host IP:8080 ‚Üí Container IP:80       |
| **Macvlan/IPvlan** | ‚úÖ Yes (on LAN)          | ‚ùå Not required         | ‚úÖ Yes (on network)    | Container appears as physical device |
| **Overlay**        | ‚ùå No                    | ‚úÖ Possible (via Swarm) | ‚úÖ Yes                 | Works across multiple hosts          |
| **None**           | üö´ No Networking         | ‚ùå Not possible         | ‚ùå No IP               | Completely isolated                  |

> With `bridge`, you're forwarding ports to reach the container. With `host`, you're bypassing that‚Äîservices inside the container behave as if they were installed directly on the host.

---

### üß† Real-Life Analogy

- **Host Network** ‚Üí Like installing your app directly on the host‚Äôs OS.
- **Bridge Network** ‚Üí Like placing your app in a virtual room and opening a door labeled ‚ÄúPort 8080‚Äù so people can come in.

So when you bind `8080:80` in bridge mode, you're **creating a port-forwarding rule**, but the container still lives on a different IP.

23. What‚Äôs the difference between COPY and ADD?</summary><br>

| Feature                  | `COPY`                          | `ADD`                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| üìÅ Basic File Copy       | ‚úÖ Yes                          | ‚úÖ Yes                                       |
| üåê Remote URL Support    | ‚ùå No                           | ‚úÖ Can fetch files from URLs                 |
| üì¶ Auto-Extract Archives | ‚ùå No                           | ‚úÖ Automatically extracts `.tar`, `.gz`, etc |
| üîê Security & Clarity    | ‚úÖ Safer and more predictable   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Can behave unexpectedly                   |
| üìú Best Practice         | ‚úÖ Preferred for most use cases | üö´ Use only when extra features are needed   |

### üß™ Examples

#### ‚úÖ COPY (Recommended)

```Dockerfile
COPY ./app /usr/src/app
```

Copies local `app` folder into the image‚Äî**no surprises**.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è ADD (Use with caution)

```Dockerfile
ADD https://example.com/app.tar.gz /usr/src/app/
```

Downloads and **extracts** the archive automatically.

---

### üß† Best Practice

> Use `COPY` for **simple, local file transfers**.  
> Use `ADD` **only** if you need to **extract archives** or **download from URLs**.

</br></details>

---

<details><summary>
24. How could you secure your Dockerfile?</summary><br>

### üîê 1. Use Trusted Base Images (Enable Docker Content Trust (DCT))

> Content trust is disabled by default in the Docker Client. To enable it, set the DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST environment variable to 1. This prevents users from working with tagged images unless they contain a signature.

- Prefer **official images** or those from verified publishers.
- Choose **minimal images** like `alpine` to reduce vulnerabilities.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-alpine
```

---

### üë§ 2. Drop Root Privileges

- Always run your app as a **non-root user**.

```Dockerfile
RUN adduser -D appuser
USER appuser
```

---

### üßπ 3. Clean Up After Installing

- Remove caches and temp files to reduce image size and risk.

```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache curl && rm -rf /var/cache/*
```

---

### üßº 4. Use `.dockerignore`

- Prevent sensitive or unnecessary files from being copied into the image.

```plaintext
# .dockerignore
.git
.env
node_modules
```

---

### üß™ 5. Scan for Vulnerabilities

- Use tools like **Trivy**, **Snyk**, or `docker scan` to check for known issues.

```bash
docker scan myimage
```

---

### üß± 6. Use Multi-Stage Builds

- Separate build tools from runtime to keep the final image lean and secure.

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.21 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

FROM alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /usr/local/bin/
USER nobody
CMD ["myapp"]
```

---

### üîí 7. Pin Image Versions

- Avoid using `latest`; pin to specific versions or digests for consistency.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine@sha256:abc123...
```

---

### üö´ 8. Avoid Secrets in Dockerfile

- Don‚Äôt hardcode credentials or tokens.
- Use environment variables or secret management tools instead.

### ¬©Ô∏è 9. Use COPY instead of ADD in Dockerfile

- COPY is more secure than ADD.

26. What‚Äôs the difference between Reverse Proxy and Web Server?</summary><br>

| Component         | Role in Architecture                                      | Who It Talks To                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Web Server**    | Serves content directly to clients (e.g. HTML, CSS, APIs) | Talks **directly to clients**        |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Sits in front of one or more web servers, routes requests | Talks to **clients and web servers** |

---

### üß™ Example Scenario

Imagine a user visits `example.com`:

- **Web Server** (like Apache or Nginx):

  - Receives the request.
  - Responds with the website content.
  - Handles things like static files, server-side scripts, etc.

- **Reverse Proxy** (like Nginx, HAProxy, or Cloudflare):
  - Intercepts the request **before** it reaches the web server.
  - Decides which backend server to forward it to.
  - Can cache, load balance, or terminate SSL.

---

### üîê Why Use a Reverse Proxy?

- **Security**: Hides internal server IPs.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
- **Caching**: Speeds up repeated requests.
- **SSL Termination**: Offloads encryption work from backend servers.

33. What‚Äôs LVM and how can using it?</summary><br>

LVM, or **Logical Volume Manager**, is a powerful system in Linux that lets you manage disk storage more flexibly than traditional partitioning. Think of it as a way to **build virtual partitions** that can grow, shrink, or move‚Äîwithout the usual headaches.

---

### üß† What Is LVM?

Instead of dividing a disk into fixed partitions, LVM lets you:

- Combine multiple disks into a **single storage pool**.
- Create **logical volumes** from that pool.
- Resize volumes **on the fly**, even while the system is running.
- Take **snapshots** for backups or testing.

---

### üß± Key Components

| Component                | Description                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Physical Volume (PV)** | Raw disk or partition used as storage |
| **Volume Group (VG)**    | Pool of one or more physical volumes  |
| **Logical Volume (LV)**  | Virtual partition created from the VG |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use LVM (Basic Workflow)

1. **Create Physical Volumes**

   ```bash
   pvcreate /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
   ```

2. **Create a Volume Group**

   ```bash
   vgcreate my_vg /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
   ```

3. **Create Logical Volumes**

   ```bash
   lvcreate -L 10G -n my_lv my_vg
   ```

4. **Format and Mount**

   ```bash
   mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/my_lv
   mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt
   ```

---

### üîÑ Resize Example

- **Extend volume**:

  ```bash
  lvextend -L +5G /dev/my_vg/my_lv
  resize2fs /dev/my_vg/my_lv
  ```

- **Shrink volume** (requires unmounting and caution):

  ```bash
  umount /mnt
  e2fsck -f /dev/my_vg/my_lv
  resize2fs /dev/my_vg/my_lv 8G
  lvreduce -L 8G /dev/my_vg/my_lv
  ```

---

### üß™ Snapshot Example

```bash
lvcreate -L 1G -s -n my_snapshot /dev/my_vg/my_lv
```

This creates a snapshot of your volume‚Äîgreat for backups or testing changes.

---

### üöÄ Why Use LVM?

- Resize volumes without rebooting.
- Combine multiple disks into one logical space.
- Easily migrate data between disks.
- Create snapshots for safe experimentation.

39. What‚Äôs the /dev/null directory?</summary><br><b>

In Linux, `/dev/null` isn‚Äôt actually a **directory**‚Äîit‚Äôs a **special device file** often called the **bit bucket** or **black hole** of the system.

---

### üï≥Ô∏è What Is `/dev/null`?

- It‚Äôs a **virtual device** that **discards all data written to it**.
- Reading from it returns **nothing** (EOF).
- It‚Äôs used to **suppress output** or **errors** from commands.

```bash
echo "Hello" > /dev/null   # Output disappears
ls /fakepath 2> /dev/null  # Suppresses error messages
```

---

### üîê Scenario: Searching `/var/log` for the word `"denied"`

You want to check for any access denials across system log files:

```bash
grep "denied" /var/log/* 2>/dev/null
```

---

### üìå What Happens?

- ‚úÖ Some files (like `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/auth.log`) are readable ‚Üí You get matches.
- ‚ùå Others (like `/var/log/audit/audit.log`) may be **restricted to root** ‚Üí You get `Permission denied`.

By redirecting `2>/dev/null`, you're telling the shell to **ignore error messages** from files you can‚Äôt access.

---

### üí° Want to log errors instead?

Rather than discarding, you could redirect them to a separate file for review:

```bash
grep "denied" /var/log/* 1>matches.txt 2>errors.txt
```

Now:

- ‚úÖ `matches.txt` has your useful results.
- ‚ùå `errors.txt` shows which files had permission issues.

---

### üìÅ Is It a Directory?

Nope! Despite the name, `/dev/null` is a **character device file**, not a directory. If you try to treat it like a directory:

```bash
ls /dev/null/
```

You‚Äôll get:

```ini
/dev/null: Not a directory
```

---

### üß† Why Is It Useful?

- **Clean logs**: Prevent clutter by discarding unwanted output.
- **Silent scripts**: Run commands quietly without showing errors.
- **Secure deletion**: Overwrite files with null bytes (e.g. `cat /dev/null > file.txt`).

## Kubernetes Questions:

<details><summary>
40. What are Kubernetes architecture components and explain them?</summary><br><b>

The main componehnts of a Kubernetes cluster include: **Nodes, Image Registry, Pods**
\-------------------------------------------
**Kubernetes Core Components: Control Plane(Master Node):** - **kube-apiserver**. Provides an API that serves as the front end of a Kubernetes control plane. ... - **etcd**: The key-value store where all data relating to the cluster is stored - **kube-scheduler**. When a new Pod is created, this component assigns it to a node for execution based on resource requirements, policies, and ‚Äòaffinity‚Äô specifications regarding geolocation and interference with other workloads. - **kube-controller-manager**. Although a Kubernetes cluster has several controller functions, they are all compiled into a single binary known as kube-controller-manager.
\-----------------------------------------------
**Node components include: (Worker Node)** - **kubelet**: Every node has an agent called kubelet. It ensures that the container described in PodSpecs is up and running properly. - **kube-proxy**: A network proxy on each node that maintains network nodes that allow for the communication from Pods to network sessions, whether inside or outside the cluster, using operating system (OS) packet filtering if available. - **container runtime**: Software responsible for running the containerized applications. Although Docker is the most popular, Kubernetes supports any runtime that adheres to the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).

<details><summary>
41. What‚Äôs the difference between Master and Worker Node?</summary><br><b>

**Worker Node**: - Do all the Work - Responsible for running the containers and doing any work assigned to them by the master node - Many nodes - Consist of **3** components: kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime

    **Master Node**:
    - Create the control plane
    - Looks after scheduling and scaling applications. maintaining the state of the cluster.
    - 1 or two nodes
    - Consist of **4** components: etcd, kube controller manager, kube-API-server, kube-schedular

</b></details>

---

<details><summary>
42. What are service types?</summary><br><b>

    -  **ClusterIP** (default): Internal clients send requests to a stable internal IP address.

    -  **NodePort**: Clients send requests to the IP address of a node on one or more nodePort values that are specified by the Service.

    -  **LoadBalancer:** Clients send requests to the IP address of a network load balancer.

    -  **ExternalName**: Internal clients use the DNS name of a Service as an alias for an external DNS name.

    -  **Headless**: when you want a Pod grouping, but don't need a stable IP address.


    The **NodePort** type is an extension of the **ClusterIP** type. So a Service of the type NodePort has a cluster IP address.



    The **LoadBalancer** type is an extension of the **NodePort** type. So a Service of type **LoadBalancer** has a cluster IP address and one or more **nodePort** values.

43. What‚Äôs the difference between deployment vs DaemonSet vs StatfulSet?</summary><br><b>

- **Deployments** and ReplicationControllers are meant for stateless usage and are rather lightweight.
- **Statefulsets**: is used for Stateful applications (DB), each replica of the pod will have its own state, and will be using its own Volume.
- **DaemonSet**: is a controller similar to **ReplicaSet** that ensures that the pod runs on all the nodes of the cluster.

  **A Daemonset will not run more than one replica per node**. Another advantage of using a Daemonset is that, if you add a node to the cluster, then the Daemonset will automatically spawn a pod on that node, which a deployment will not do

<details><summary>
46. How can create a variable for your deployment and how can secure it?</summary><br><b>

      **Secrets** can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables to be used by a container in a Pod.

Secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the Pod.

</b></details>

---

<details><summary>
47. Is it possible to create multiple containers in one pod?</summary><br><b>

YES ‚Äì but better be one container/Pod
because each container should do one task so if you have 2 containers in a pod and you are near to increase one container because its service/task has a lot of traffic ... then k8s will create a new pod with two containers that the second is not doing anything so you are wasting your compute capacity.

</b></details>

---

<details><summary>
48. What‚Äôs a Sidecar container?</summary><br><b>

    - Sidecar containers are containers that run along with the main container in a pod. You can define any number of sidecar containers to run alongside the main container
    - The sidecar containers can also share storage volumes with the main containers, allowing the main containers to access the data in the sidecars.
    - The primary application can run independently in one container while the sidecar hosts complementary processes and tools

<details><summary>
51. What‚Äôs the difference between liveness vs readiness vs startup probes?</summary><br><b>

**liveness**:
**Liveness Probe**: Checks if a container is running properly and restarts it if the probe fails.
**Readiness Probe**: Checks if a container is ready to receive network traffic and delays routing until it becomes ready.
**Startup Prob**e: Checks the initial startup readiness of a container, helping differentiate slow starts from unresponsive containers.
