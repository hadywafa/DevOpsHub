# AWS Migration Strategies: The 7 R‚Äôs

When migrating applications to the cloud, AWS provides a **framework of seven migration strategies**, commonly referred to as the **7 R‚Äôs**. These strategies help organizations evaluate their applications and decide the best path to successfully move to the cloud while meeting business objectives.

## üåü **The 7 R‚Äôs of Cloud Migration**

### 1. **ReHost (Lift-and-Shift)**

- **Definition**: Move applications to the cloud with minimal or no modifications.
- **Use Case**:
  - Quickly migrate legacy applications or workloads.
  - Suitable for applications where code changes are not feasible.
- **Example**:
  - Moving an on-premises web application to **EC2** without re-architect.

---

### 2. **RePlatform (Lift-and-Optimize)**

- **Definition**: Move applications to the cloud with some optimizations to take advantage of cloud features.
- **Use Case**:
  - Improve performance or scalability with minor code changes.
  - Add automation or migrate to managed services like **RDS** or **ElastiCache**.
- **Example**:
  - Migrating a database from on-premises to **Amazon RDS** and using read replicas.

---

### 3. **Repurchase (Drop-and-Shop)**

- **Definition**: Replace on-premises applications with **SaaS** or cloud-native alternatives.
- **Use Case**:
  - Replace legacy systems with modern, off-the-shelf software solutions.
  - Reduce operational overhead and software licensing costs.
- **Example**:
  - Moving from an on-premises CRM to **Salesforce** or **AWS WorkSpaces**.

---

### 4. **Refactor (Re-architect)**

- **Definition**: Redesign applications to be cloud-native by leveraging modern architectures and technologies.
- **Use Case**:
  - Applications that need significant code changes to meet new business needs.
  - Implement microservices, serverless architectures, or containers.
- **Example**:
  - Migrating a monolithic application to a **microservices architecture** using **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon ECS**.

---

### 5. **Retire**

- **Definition**: Identify and decommission unused or unnecessary applications.
- **Use Case**:
  - Eliminate redundant workloads, reduce costs, and simplify the environment.
- **Example**:
  - Shutting down an old application no longer serving any purpose.

---

### 6. **Retain (Revisit)**

- **Definition**: Keep certain applications on-premises or in their current state, often for the short term.
- **Use Case**:
  - Applications that are not ready for migration or require significant preparation.
  - Retain legacy systems until a comprehensive migration strategy is defined.
- **Example**:
  - Keeping a mission-critical database on-premises until a suitable migration plan is developed.

---

### 7. **Relocate**

- **Definition**: Move applications to the cloud without purchasing new hardware or software, using virtualization or hybrid solutions.
- **Use Case**:
  - Migrate entire virtualized environments to AWS with minimal changes.
- **Example**:
  - Migrating VMware workloads to **VMware Cloud on AWS**.

---

## üåê **Choosing the Right Migration Strategy**

### Factors to Consider

1. **Application Complexity**:
   - Legacy or complex applications may require refactoring or retaining.
2. **Business Goals**:
   - Does the application require scalability, cost savings, or faster deployment?
3. **Time-frame**:
   - Tight deadlines may favor reHosting or rePlatforming.
4. **Cost**:
   - Balance between operational savings and migration costs.

## üìö **Conclusion**

The **7 R‚Äôs of AWS Migration Strategies** provide a structured approach to transitioning to the cloud. Whether you're lifting and shifting, refactoring, or replacing applications, each strategy offers a path tailored to specific business needs and technical requirements. By choosing the right approach, organizations can minimize risk, optimize performance, and maximize the benefits of their cloud journey.
