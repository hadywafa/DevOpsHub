## Notes

### ü§î AWS CDK vs AWS SDK ?

Great question! While both AWS CDK and AWS SDK are powerful tools for interacting with AWS, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)

- **Purpose**: Used to define cloud infrastructure using high-level programming languages.
- **Usage**: Instead of writing raw CloudFormation templates in JSON or YAML, you can define your AWS infrastructure using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C#, and Java.
- **Functionality**: Provides constructs, which are reusable components of cloud infrastructure. These constructs simplify the process of defining complex infrastructure setups.
- **Example**: You can use AWS CDK to define an entire stack of resources, such as an S3 bucket, Lambda function, and DynamoDB table, all within your code.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ AWS SDK (Software Development Kit)

- **Purpose**: Used to interact with AWS services programmatically.
- **Usage**: Allows developers to write code that communicates with AWS services using various programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.).
- **Functionality**: Provides APIs to interact with AWS services, such as uploading a file to S3, invoking a Lambda function, or querying a DynamoDB table.
- **Example**: You can use the AWS SDK to upload a file to an S3 bucket or retrieve data from a DynamoDB table within your application code.

#### üÜö Key Differences

1. **Purpose**:

   - AWS CDK is primarily for defining and provisioning infrastructure.
   - AWS SDK is for interacting with and managing AWS services programmatically.

2. **Usage**:

   - AWS CDK uses high-level programming languages to define cloud resources.
   - AWS SDK provides APIs for programmatically interacting with AWS services.

3. **Scope**:
   - AWS CDK focuses on infrastructure as code (IaC).
   - AWS SDK is used for building applications that interact with AWS services.
