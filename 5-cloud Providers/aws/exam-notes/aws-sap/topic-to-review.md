## **AZ Name vs AZ ID** ðŸ†”

An **Availability Zone ID** is a **unique, immutable identifier** for an AWS **Availability Zone (AZ)** within a region. Each AZ ID is consistent across accounts, ensuring that you can refer to the same physical infrastructure irrespective of account or region mapping differences.

- **Availability Zone IDs**: `use1-az1`, `use1-az2`
