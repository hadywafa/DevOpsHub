# **🚀 EC2 Auto Scaling – Launch Configuration vs. Launch Template**

When you're setting up an **EC2 Auto Scaling Group**, you need a blueprint for what your instances should look like — that's where **Launch Templates** come in.

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> As of **May 31, 2023**, AWS recommends using **Launch Templates only**. **Launch Configurations** are deprecated and will no longer be supported in the EC2 Console. Support via CLI/API will end on **December 31, 2023**.

## **📜 What Is a Launch Template?**

A **Launch Template** is a modern, flexible, and reusable configuration for launching EC2 instances within Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs). It defines:

- AMI ID
- Instance types (one or multiple)
- Key pair and IAM role
- EBS volumes
- Security groups
- Spot/On-Demand preferences
- User data scripts
- Placement groups, capacity reservations, Elastic IPs

Launch Templates support **versioning**, allowing you to create different configurations under the same template name and switch easily between them.
