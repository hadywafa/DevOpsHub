# 🚀 IOPS vs. Throughput

When dealing with Amazon EC2 and EBS volumes, two performance metrics are absolutely critical:

- ✅ **IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)**
- ✅ **Throughput (MB/s or GB/s)**

Understanding these two metrics helps you **optimize your storage** for performance and cost. Let’s break them down.

## 📌 What Is Throughput?

> **Throughput = Data Volume per Second**

### 📦 Definition

Throughput is the **total amount of data** that can be read from or written to a storage device **per second**.

### 📏 Measured In

- **MB/s (Megabytes per second)**
- **GB/s (Gigabytes per second)**

### 📊 Focus

- Throughput emphasizes the **volume of data**, not the number of operations.
- Important for workloads that move **large amounts of data**, like **log ingestion**, **video processing**, or **backup operations**.

### 🧠 Example

If a volume has **500 MB/s** throughput, it can transfer **500 megabytes of data every second**, whether that’s one large file or many small ones.

## 📌 What Is IOPS?

> **IOPS = Read/Write Operations per Second**

### ⚙️ Definition

IOPS stands for **Input/Output Operations Per Second** — it measures how many **read/write operations** your storage can handle in one second.

### 📏 Measured In

- **Operations/second**

### 📊 Focus

- IOPS focuses on the **number of input/output operations**, not the size of the data being transferred.
- Crucial for **transactional** workloads that involve **frequent small reads/writes**, like **databases** or **real-time applications**.

### 🧠 Example

If a system supports **3,000 IOPS**, it can process **3,000 read or write operations every second**, regardless of their size.

## 🧪 IOPS vs. Throughput – What’s the Difference?

| Metric         | Focus           | Measures                         | Ideal For                             |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **IOPS**       | Operation Count | Number of read/write actions/sec | Databases, OLTP systems, frequent I/O |
| **Throughput** | Data Volume     | MB/s or GB/s                     | Streaming, Big Data, backups          |

- IOPS = Think of many **small, frequent requests**
- Throughput = Think of **large, sequential data transfers**

## 📦 How IOPS and Throughput Affect EBS

### 🧱 EBS Volume Types and Performance

| Volume Type                        | Max IOPS      | Max Throughput   | Use Case                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **gp3** (General Purpose SSD)      | Up to 16,000  | Up to 1,000 MB/s | General workloads, customizable IOPS |
| **io2/io1** (Provisioned IOPS SSD) | Up to 256,000 | Up to 4,000 MB/s | Databases, latency-sensitive apps    |
| **st1** (Throughput-Optimized HDD) | Up to 500     | Up to 500 MB/s   | Big data, data lakes                 |
| **sc1** (Cold HDD)                 | Up to 250     | Up to 250 MB/s   | Archive, infrequently accessed data  |

## 🎯 How to Choose Between IOPS and Throughput?

When provisioning EBS volumes:

- Prioritize **IOPS** when:

  - You're running a **high-performance database** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  - You need consistent, fast access to **small records**
  - You're supporting **real-time applications**

- Prioritize **Throughput** when:
  - You're processing **large files** (e.g., media processing)
  - You’re using **data warehouses**, **log pipelines**, or **ETL jobs**
  - You care more about **volume speed** than request rate

---

## 🛠️ Monitoring IOPS and Throughput in AWS

Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to track:

- `VolumeReadOps` / `VolumeWriteOps` = **IOPS**
- `VolumeReadBytes` / `VolumeWriteBytes` = **Throughput**
- `VolumeQueueLength` = Check if the volume is **overloaded**

> 🧠 If queue length is high but IOPS is low, your volume may be throttled.

---

## 📌 Tuning Tips

- Use **gp3** for baseline workloads — customize IOPS and throughput separately.
- Use **io1/io2** for mission-critical workloads that need **super-high IOPS**.
- Pre-warm large volumes by writing dummy data to **initialize performance**.
- Monitor **burst limits** on `gp2` and avoid surprise performance drops.

## ✅ Summary

| Metric         | Measures                           | Unit         | Best For                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **IOPS**       | Input/output operations per second | Ops/sec      | Databases, frequent small I/Os |
| **Throughput** | Data transfer per second           | MB/s or GB/s | Big data, backups, media jobs  |

Both **IOPS and Throughput** are **equally important** — which one matters more depends entirely on **your workload profile**.
