# ⚙️ **Lambda Execution Models**

AWS Lambda supports three primary execution models: **Synchronous**, **Asynchronous**, and **Poll-Based**. Understanding these models helps in designing how your functions respond to different triggers and manage responses effectively.

## 1. 🕒 **Synchronous Invocation**

**Synchronous Invocation** occurs when a service invokes a Lambda function and waits for the function to process the event and return a response.

### 📌 **Key Characteristics:**

- **Immediate Response:** The invoking service waits for the Lambda function to complete and receive its response.
- **Use Cases:** Suitable for scenarios where the response from the function is needed immediately, such as API requests handled by API Gateway.

### 🔄 **Flow:**

1. An event source (e.g., API Gateway) sends a request to Lambda.
2. Lambda executes the function and processes the event.
3. Upon completion, Lambda returns the response to the invoking service.

## 2. 🔄 **Asynchronous Invocation**

**Asynchronous Invocation** allows services to invoke Lambda functions without waiting for a response. The event is queued and processed by Lambda independently.

### 📌 **Key Characteristics:**

- **Non-blocking:** The invoking service does not wait for the Lambda function to complete.
- **Use Cases:** Ideal for background processing, such as image processing triggered by S3 uploads or sending notifications via SNS.

### 🔄 **Flow:**

1. An event source (e.g., S3, SNS) sends an event to Lambda.
2. Lambda receives the event and queues it for processing.
3. Lambda executes the function asynchronously, handling the event without impacting the invoking service.

## 3. 🐘 **Poll-Based Invocation / Event Source Mapping**

**Poll-Based Invocation** involves the Lambda service polling for events from specific sources and invoking functions when new events are detected.

### 📌 **Key Characteristics:**

- **Event Detection:** Lambda continuously polls the event source for new data or changes.
- **Use Cases:** Suitable for services that emit events to queues or streams, such as Amazon SQS, Amazon Kinesis, or DynamoDB Streams.

### 🔄 **Flow:**

1. Lambda polls the event source (e.g., SQS, Kinesis) for new events.
2. When new events are detected, Lambda invokes the function to process them.
3. The function handles the events, and Lambda manages the polling and invocation process automatically.
