# üîÑ **AWS Lambda Concurrent Execution**

**Concurrent execution** in AWS Lambda refers to the ability to invoke multiple instances of a Lambda function simultaneously. This ensures that your applications can handle multiple requests at the same time without delays.

## üö´ **Without Reserved Concurrency**

By default, AWS Lambda manages concurrency across all functions within an account and region. Understanding how Lambda behaves without reserved concurrency is essential for anticipating performance and throttling scenarios.

### üìå **Key Points:**

- **Default Regional Concurrency Quota:**

  - Starts at **1,000** (soft limit) for all functions in an account within a specific region.

- **Aggregate Concurrency:**

  - The **total concurrent executions** across all Lambda functions in the region cannot exceed the regional quota.

- **Throttling:**

  - If the **aggregate concurrent regional concurrency quota** is reached, additional Lambda invocations will be **throttled**, meaning they will be denied until concurrency becomes available.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Considerations:**

- **Shared Quota:** All Lambda functions in the region share the same concurrency pool, which can lead to unexpected throttling if multiple functions are invoked simultaneously.

- **Scaling Limits:** Without reserved concurrency, scaling is managed automatically, but hitting the regional quota can impact the performance of your applications.

## ‚úÖ **With Reserved Concurrency**

**Reserved Concurrency** allows you to allocate a specific number of concurrent executions to individual Lambda functions, ensuring that critical functions have the necessary resources to operate without interference from other functions.

### üìå **Key Points:**

- **Guaranteed Concurrency:**

  - Ensures that a **desired concurrency level** is always available for a specific Lambda function.

- **Isolation:**

  - **No Sharing:** Other functions cannot use the reserved concurrency for that particular function, preventing throttling due to shared limits.

- **Configuration:**

  - Set at the **function level** and is **free of charge**.

- **Control Over Execution:**

  - Allows you to **control the limit** of each function's concurrent execution, providing better management of resources and costs.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Configuration Steps:**

1. **Navigate to the Lambda Console:**

   - Select your Lambda function from the AWS Management Console.

2. **Access Concurrency Settings:**

   - Go to the **"Configuration"** tab and select **"Concurrency"**.

3. **Set Reserved Concurrency:**

   - Enable **"Reserve concurrency"** and specify the desired number of concurrent executions.

4. **Save Changes:**
   - Apply the settings to enforce the reserved concurrency limit.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Considerations:**

- **Throttling Beyond Reserved Limit:**

  - Invocations beyond the reserved concurrency limit for a function will be **throttled**, ensuring that the function does not exceed its allocated resources.

- **Impact on Regional Quota:**
  - Reserved concurrency **deducts** from the regional concurrency quota, so plan allocations accordingly to avoid exhausting the regional limits.

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Comparison: Without vs. With Reserved Concurrency**

| **Aspect**               | **Without Reserved Concurrency**                              | **With Reserved Concurrency**                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrency Quota**    | Shared regional quota (default 1,000)                         | Specific concurrency reserved for each function                 |
| **Throttling Behavior**  | Throttles when regional quota is exceeded                     | Throttles only when function's reserved concurrency is exceeded |
| **Resource Isolation**   | No isolation; all functions share the same pool               | Isolated; reserved concurrency ensures function-specific limits |
| **Configuration**        | No additional setup required                                  | Must be explicitly configured per function                      |
| **Cost**                 | Pay for all concurrent executions                             | Reserved concurrency is free; pay for usage beyond limits only  |
| **Use Case Suitability** | General-purpose applications without strict concurrency needs | Critical functions requiring guaranteed concurrency             |

## üèÅ **Conclusion**

Managing concurrent executions in AWS Lambda is crucial for maintaining the performance and reliability of your serverless applications. By understanding the differences between operating **without** and **with reserved concurrency**, you can make informed decisions to allocate resources effectively, prevent throttling, and ensure that your critical functions always have the necessary capacity to handle incoming requests.

Implementing **reserved concurrency** is particularly beneficial for applications with **predictable workloads** or those requiring **high availability**. It provides **resource isolation**, allowing you to maintain control over how your Lambda functions scale and perform under varying loads.
