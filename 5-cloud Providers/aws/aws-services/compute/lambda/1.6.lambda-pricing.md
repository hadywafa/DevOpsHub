# üí∞ **AWS Lambda: Pricing**

AWS Lambda offers a cost-effective pricing model based on usage.

## üìä **Pricing Breakdown:**

| **Component** | **Cost**                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Requests**  | \$0.20 per 1 million requests                       |
| **Duration**  | \$0.0000166667 for every GB-Second                  |
| **Free Tier** | 1 million requests and 400,000 GB-Seconds per month |

### üí° **Example Calculation:**

- **Scenario:** A Lambda function with 30 million requests per month, 512 MB memory, and 6 minutes (360 seconds) execution time.

  **Calculation:**

  - **Requests Cost:** 30M requests √ó ($0.20 / 1M) = **$6.00\*\*
  - **Duration Cost:**
    - Memory in GB: 512 MB = 0.5 GB
    - Execution Time: 360 seconds
    - Total GB-Seconds: 0.5 GB √ó 360 seconds = 180 GB-Seconds
    - Cost: 180 √ó $0.0000166667 = **$0.003\*\*
  - **Total Monthly Cost:** **~$6.00 + $0.003 = ~\$6.00**

  **Note:** The provided example in the reference (~\$90,000/month) likely includes additional factors or higher usage parameters. Ensure accurate calculations using the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lambda-tools/pricing-calculator.html).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost Warning:**

- **Higher Memory & Longer Execution:** Increasing memory allocation and execution timeout can significantly raise costs.
- **Unsuitable for Long-Running Tasks:** Lambda functions are not designed for prolonged workflows due to escalating costs.

## üèÅ **Conclusion**

AWS Lambda revolutionizes how you build and deploy applications by eliminating the need to manage servers. With automatic scaling, high availability, and a pay-as-you-go pricing model, Lambda is ideal for event-driven architectures, short-lived tasks, and applications with variable workloads. However, it's essential to consider the cost implications of memory and execution time configurations, especially for long-running processes.

By leveraging AWS Lambda's robust features and understanding its pricing model, you can build scalable, efficient, and cost-effective applications tailored to your business needs.
