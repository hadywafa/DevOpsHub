# 🔄 **AWS Lambda Recursion Detection – Stopping Infinite Loops**

Lambda recursion happens when a **Lambda function unintentionally calls itself repeatedly**, leading to **infinite loops** and excessive cost. AWS provides **built-in mechanisms** to detect and prevent unintended recursion.

---

## 🛑 **How Does Lambda Recursion Happen?**

✔️ **Self-Invocation** – A Lambda function **directly invokes itself** within its code.  
✔️ **Event Source Loops** – A Lambda **writes to an event source** that triggers itself again (e.g., S3, SQS, DynamoDB).  
✔️ **Incorrect Retry Logic** – Unhandled errors cause a function **to re-trigger itself indefinitely**.

💡 **Example of Unintentional Recursion**:

```python
import boto3

lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Lambda calls itself unintentionally
    lambda_client.invoke(
        FunctionName=context.function_name,
        InvocationType='Event'
    )
    return "Recursion happening!"
```

💥 **Issue?** This function keeps calling itself forever! 🚨

## 🔍 **AWS Recursion Detection & Prevention**

✔️ **AWS Automatically Detects Recursion in Some Event Sources**

- **S3 Event Notifications** – AWS **blocks repeated triggers** for the same object.
- **CloudWatch Logs** – AWS **prevents loops** when logs trigger Lambda, which then logs again.  
  ✔️ **Set Maximum Retry Limits**
- Use **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)** or **Lambda Destinations** to capture failed invocations instead of retrying infinitely.  
  ✔️ **Add an Invocation Counter**
- Track the number of times a Lambda function **has executed within the same request**.

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    if 'recursion_count' in event and event['recursion_count'] > 3:
        return "Recursion limit reached!"

    event['recursion_count'] = event.get('recursion_count', 0) + 1
    lambda_client.invoke(
        FunctionName=context.function_name,
        InvocationType='Event',
        Payload=json.dumps(event)
    )
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices to Prevent Lambda Recursion**

✔️ **Use Conditional Checks** – Prevent self-invocation based on an identifier.  
✔️ **Enable DLQs for SQS & SNS** – Avoid infinite retries by capturing failed messages.  
✔️ **Limit S3 Event Loops** – Filter events to avoid triggering Lambda on objects created by itself.  
✔️ **Use Idempotency Keys** – Track processed events to prevent duplicate executions.

---

## 🚀 **Final Takeaways**

✔️ **Recursion can cause infinite loops & unexpected costs** – be cautious!  
✔️ **AWS provides some built-in recursion detection**, but not for all cases.  
✔️ **Implement safeguards like retry limits, DLQs, and conditional logic** to avoid self-invocation issues.
