# ðŸ“¦ **Example: Configuring S3 Event Notifications to Trigger Lambda**

1. **Enable Versioning on S3 Bucket:**

   - Navigate to your S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
   - Enable **Versioning** to ensure all object write actions trigger notifications.

2. **Create a Lambda Function:**

   - Go to the AWS Lambda console.
   - Click on **"Create function"** and provide the necessary details.
   - Implement your function code to process S3 events.

3. **Set Up S3 Event Notifications:**

   - In the S3 bucket settings, go to **"Properties"** > **"Event notifications"**.
   - Create a new event notification and specify the event types (e.g., object creation).
   - Choose **"Lambda Function"** as the destination and select your function.

4. **Assign Permissions:**

   - Ensure the Lambda function's **resource-based policy** allows S3 to invoke it.
   - The default execution role should include permissions to write logs to CloudWatch.

5. **Test the Trigger:**

   - Upload or delete an object in the S3 bucket to verify that the Lambda function is invoked correctly.
