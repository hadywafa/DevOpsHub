# üîÑ ELB Types and Their Key Differences

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) supports multiple types of load balancers, each optimized for specific use cases, protocols, and workloads. Below, we explore the **four types of ELBs**‚ÄîCLB, ALB, NLB, and GWLB‚Äîby diving into how each works, their architectures, supported protocols, and use cases.

## **üåê 1. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**

</div>

---

### üí° Key

- **Layers**: Layer 4 (TCP) & Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
- **Target Type**: EC2 instances only
- **Legacy**: It‚Äôs AWS‚Äôs original load balancer, now largely superseded by ALB and NLB
- **Health Checks**: Basic TCP or HTTP checks

### ‚ú® Features

- Basic load balancing capabilities.
- Limited routing features compared to newer ELB types.
- No support for container-based workloads.
- No native integration with AWS Auto Scaling or EC2 Container Service (ECS).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Internals

- Directs traffic to registered EC2 instances.
- No support for containers, microservices, or path-based routing.
- Each listener can only route to a **single backend pool**.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Legacy applications
- Monolithic apps not requiring advanced routing features

## **üî• 2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/alb.png" alt="Application Load Balancer" style="border-radius: 10px;">
</div>

---

### üí° Key

- **Layers**: Layer 7 (Application ‚Äì HTTP/HTTPS)
- **Target Type**: Target Groups (EC2, ECS tasks, Lambda, IPs)
- **Routing Features**: Host-based, path-based, query-string-based
- **Health Checks**: Configurable per target group

### ‚ú® Features

- Provides **content-based routing**, meaning you can route requests based on URL paths or host names.
- Supports WebSocket and HTTP/2 for improved performance.
- Native support for containerized applications via ECS.
- Enhanced routing capabilities such as path-based routing, host-based routing, and query string-based routing.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Internals

- Uses listeners and rules to route HTTP requests intelligently.
- Listeners match **host headers**, **paths**, **HTTP methods**, or **query strings**.
- Native support for **WebSocket** and **HTTP/2**.
- Supports **containerized workloads** via ECS with dynamic port mapping.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Microservices
- Containerized applications
- Dynamic web apps needing granular routing logic

## **‚ö° 3. Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

  <img src="images/nlb.png" alt="Network Load Balancer" style="border-radius: 10px;">
</div>

---

### üí° Keys

- **Layers**: Layer 4 (Transport ‚Äì TCP/UDP/TLS)
- **Target Type**: Target Groups (EC2, IPs, Lambda)
- **Routing Mechanism**: Flow Hash (source/destination IP:Port)
- **Latency**: Microsecond-level

### ‚ú® Features

- Extremely **low latency** and high throughput.
- **Static IP support**, making it ideal for applications that require a fixed IP address.
- Supports **TLS termination**, allowing for secure communication between clients and your application.
- Ideal for applications that require high availability and need to handle volatile traffic patterns.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Internals

- Allocates **Elastic IPs (EIPs)** for each AZ.
- TLS termination and **pass-through mode** supported.
- Directly preserves the client source IP (ideal for security and analytics).

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Real-time gaming
- Financial trading platforms
- IoT and high-performance APIs

## **üîê 4. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/gwlb.png" alt="Gateway Load Balancer" style="border-radius: 10px;">
</div>

---

### üí° Keys

- **Layers**: Layer 3/4 (Generic IP forwarding)
- **Target Type**: Security appliances (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS)
- **Key Protocol**: GENEVE encapsulation (port 6081)

### ‚ú® Features

- Allows seamless integration of third-party security appliances for network traffic inspection.
- Supports **automatic scaling** based on traffic requirements.
- Commonly used to support **hybrid cloud architectures** and **secure network traffic**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Internals

- Acts as a transparent middlebox for inline inspection of network traffic.
- Integrates with **third-party appliances** and allows autoscaling and high availability.
- Used alongside **Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints (GWLBe)** for VPC service chaining.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Centralized traffic inspection
- Inline threat detection
- Compliance and security monitoring
