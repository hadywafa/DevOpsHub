## **üîç What Is VMware Cloud on AWS?**

> **Official Definition:** VMware Cloud on AWS is an integrated cloud offering jointly developed by AWS and VMware that delivers a scalable, secure cloud service based on VMware Cloud Foundation, and is optimized to run on AWS infrastructure.

It gives you a fully-managed **VMware Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC)** hosted in AWS, where you can run VMware workloads side-by-side with native AWS services.

## **üß± Core Components of VMware Cloud on AWS**

| Component          | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **vSphere**        | Manages your virtual machines (VMs) and clusters        |
| **vCenter Server** | Centralized control panel to manage VMs and hosts       |
| **NSX-T**          | Provides software-defined networking and security       |
| **vSAN**           | Distributed storage across AWS EC2 bare metal instances |
| **ENI**            | Elastic Network Interface connects SDDC to AWS VPCs     |

---

## **üöÄ How It Works**

- Your **VMware SDDC** is deployed on **dedicated EC2 bare-metal instances**.
- An **ENI (Elastic Network Interface)** connects your SDDC to your AWS VPC.
- This setup enables **low-latency, high-bandwidth access** to AWS services from your VMs.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Key Features**

### ‚úÖ **Seamless Integration**

Run VMware vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and vCenter **natively on AWS infrastructure** ‚Äî no re-architecting or re-coding required.

### üîÅ **Live Migration with HCX**

Use **VMware HCX** to migrate workloads live (zero downtime) from on-premises to AWS. Like moving your sofa into a bigger apartment ‚Äî while still watching Netflix on it.

### üåç **Hybrid Cloud Done Right**

Keep workloads in sync between your **on-premises data center** and AWS. Scale to the cloud when needed without losing visibility or control.

### ‚ö° **Access to AWS Services**

Let your VMs talk to AWS services like **RDS**, **S3**, **Lambda**, **CloudWatch**, and more ‚Äî all via your VPC.
