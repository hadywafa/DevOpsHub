# 📦 **Amazon EC2 AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)**

Amazon EC2 **AMIs** are your go-to solution for creating reusable, consistent, and pre-configured templates of your compute environments. Think of an AMI as a **golden image** — a blueprint that includes the OS, software, and custom settings to help you quickly launch **identical EC2 instances** anywhere in your AWS ecosystem.

## 🔍 **What Is an EC2 AMI?**

An **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** is a **pre-packaged snapshot** of an EC2 instance that includes:

- 🖥️ Operating System (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, Windows)
- 📦 Installed Software (e.g., agents, scripts, applications)
- ⚙️ Configuration settings and runtime customizations
- 💾 One or more EBS snapshots (root and data volumes)

> ✅ Use AMIs to **quickly launch** new instances, ensure configuration consistency, and automate deployments at scale.

## 🏗️ **Creating an AMI from an EC2 Instance**

### 🧱 **Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Launch & Customize** your EC2 instance

   - Install tools, patch OS, apply configs ✅

2. **Reboot (Recommended)** to flush memory and stabilize disk state 🔁

3. **Create AMI**

   - AWS captures **snapshots of root & data volumes**
   - Registers the AMI in your account 🎯

4. **Launch New Instances** from your AMI — done! 🎉

### 🧾 **What's Included in the AMI?**

- Root volume snapshot
- All additional attached EBS volumes
- Installed software + OS + configurations

> 📦 Everything your original instance had — cloned and ready to go!

## 🔄 **Sharing AMIs with Other AWS Accounts**

### 🤝 **How to Share an AMI**

If the AMI is **unencrypted**, sharing is simple. For **encrypted AMIs**, it involves careful handling of the KMS key:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant You as Your Account
  participant KMS as KMS Key
  participant Snap as Encrypted AMI
  participant Friend as Recipient Account

  You->>KMS: Allow KMS usage (add recipient ID)
  You->>Snap: Share AMI with Friend (private mode)
  Friend->>Snap: Copy AMI to own account/region
  Friend->>KMS: Re-encrypt using their own key
  You-->>KMS: Revoke KMS access after copy
```

### 🛡️ **Key Sharing Notes**

- 🔐 Must use **custom KMS keys**, not AWS-managed ones
- 📍 AMIs can only be **shared privately** — no public sharing for encrypted images
- 📥 Copying is required before use in other accounts

## 🧳 **Copying AMIs Across Regions or Accounts**

AMIs can be copied to:

- ✅ Create regional backups
- ✅ Deploy the same stack globally
- ✅ Enable cross-account collaboration

### 🌐 **Cross-Region Copying**

- AWS **requires re-encryption** using a KMS key in the destination region
- Encrypted AMIs must use **region-local keys**

### 🚫 **Limitations**

- ❌ Marketplace and Windows AMIs **can’t be copied** directly
- ✅ Workaround: Launch instance → create new AMI → share new AMI instead
