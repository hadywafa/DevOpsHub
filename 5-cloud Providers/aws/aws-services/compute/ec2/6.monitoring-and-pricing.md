# 🖥️ EC2 Monitoring – Keep Your Instances Healthy & Happy

Keeping tabs on your EC2 instances isn’t optional — it’s essential. Monitoring ensures your applications are **running smoothly**, **performing efficiently**, and **recovering quickly** when issues arise.

Luckily, AWS gives you all the tools you need — from **built-in status checks** to **advanced CloudWatch dashboards**. Let’s explore how to monitor EC2 like a pro.

## ✅ EC2 Status Checks – Instant Health Snapshots

EC2 performs two automatic **status checks every minute** to monitor instance health:

| **Check Type**            | **What It Detects**                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Status Check**   | AWS-side problems like hardware failure, network issues, or power disruptions.      |
| **Instance Status Check** | Issues inside the instance, like OS boot failures, full disk, or memory exhaustion. |

### **⚠️ If a Status Check Fails...**

- AWS **does not auto-fix** the instance.
- But you can:
  - Create **CloudWatch Alarms** 🛎️
  - Trigger notifications via **SNS**
  - Take automatic actions like **reboot** or **recover**

## 📊 Monitor Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch

CloudWatch collects and visualizes EC2 metrics to help you detect performance anomalies.

### 🔍 Basic vs Detailed Monitoring

| **Monitoring Type**     | **Metric Frequency** | **Cost**         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Basic Monitoring**    | Every 5 minutes      | ✅ Free          |
| **Detailed Monitoring** | Every 1 minute       | 💰 ~\$2.10/month |

### 📈 Key EC2 Metrics You Can Track

| ✅ **Default (Built-in)** | 🛠️ **Custom (With CloudWatch Agent)**    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **CPU Utilization**       | **Memory Usage**                         |
| **Network In/Out**        | **Disk Space Usage**                     |
| **Disk Read/Write IOPS**  | **Disk Swap / Page File Usage**          |
|                           | **Log Collection / Application Metrics** |

> To collect **custom metrics** like RAM or disk usage, you’ll need to install and configure the **CloudWatch Agent** on your instance.

## ⏰ CloudWatch Alarms & Events – Be Proactive

CloudWatch doesn’t just monitor — it can **take action** when something goes wrong.

### 🔔 CloudWatch Alarms

You can set thresholds for any metric and respond when those thresholds are breached:

| **Action**           | **Triggered By**              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Recover**          | System Status Check failure   |
| **Reboot**           | Instance Status Check failure |
| **Stop / Terminate** | Custom condition met          |

### 🔁 CloudWatch Events (Now: EventBridge)

- Automate responses to **instance state changes**, **auto scaling**, or **app-specific events**.
- Great for **automated remediation** or **triggering Lambda functions**.

---

## 🚀 Real-World Example: Auto-Recover Your Instance

If an EC2 instance fails a **system check**, you can set a CloudWatch alarm to:

✅ **Send an SNS alert** → 📩  
✅ **Recover the instance automatically** → 🔄  
✅ **Log the incident for auditing** → 📂

All of this happens **without human intervention**.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- **Always enable detailed monitoring** for production workloads.
- Use **custom dashboards** in CloudWatch for multi-instance visibility.
- Consider **AWS Systems Manager + CloudWatch Agent** for even deeper insights (e.g., processes, OS metrics).
- Use **Alarm actions** with **IAM policies** to allow specific auto-recovery behavior.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

With **EC2 status checks** and **CloudWatch monitoring**, AWS gives you full visibility into the health and performance of your instances. Use **basic monitoring** for cost efficiency or upgrade to **detailed monitoring** for real-time insights.

And don’t just watch — **automate** your responses using alarms, events, and notifications to minimize downtime and keep your workloads reliable.
