# **💥 EC2 Spot Instances**

**Spot Instances** allow you to take advantage of unused EC2 capacity at a **massive discount** (up to 90%) compared to On-Demand pricing. These instances are ideal for applications and workloads that can tolerate interruptions, making them a cost-effective choice for many types of workloads. However, there are trade-offs when using Spot Instances regarding availability and termination risks.

## **🌟 Key Features**

- **Significantly Lower Cost**: Spot Instances offer deep discounts compared to On-Demand pricing, making them a great option for reducing cloud costs.
- **Interruptible**: Spot Instances can be terminated by AWS if the Spot price exceeds your bid or if capacity is no longer available. This means you need to plan for potential interruptions.
- **No Availability Guarantee**: Spot Instances may not always be available when you need them. They are subject to availability and can be terminated at any time by AWS.

### **🎯 Ideal Use Cases**

- **🛠️ Batch processing**
- **📊 Data analysis**
- **📝 Background processing**
- **Optional tasks** that can be scheduled flexibly.
- **Non-critical workloads** that can tolerate interruptions, such as scientific simulations or data crunching.

## **🔄 Spot Instance Request Types**

You can choose from different request types when launching Spot Instances, which will determine how the instance behaves when the Spot price changes or capacity is no longer available.

### **🕒 1. One-Time Request**

- The request is active until it’s fulfilled, expired, or manually canceled.
- Ideal for tasks that require a one-time allocation of Spot Instances.

### **🔄 2. Persistent/maintain Request**

- The request remains active until it expires or is canceled, even after the Spot Instance is fulfilled. This ensures the instance stays running and is replaced automatically if terminated.
- Best for workloads that need consistent compute capacity over a longer period.

## **🚢 Fleet Management**

In the context of **Amazon EC2**, a **fleet** refers to a **group of EC2 instances**—not just one instance—that are launched and managed together to meet a specified **target capacity** using **a mix of instance types**, **purchase options**, and **availability zones**.

Think of it like this:

> 🔧 Instead of managing one EC2 instance at a time, you define a _plan_ (the fleet), and AWS intelligently provisions the best combination of instances to meet your needs.

### **🚀 EC2 Fleet**

- **Can Launch Multiple Instance Types**: EC2 Fleet can launch instances across multiple Availability Zones in one region.
- **Define On-Demand and Spot Capacity**: You can separately define how much On-Demand or Spot capacity you need.
- **Specify Maximum Price**: You can define the maximum amount you are willing to pay for the fleet.
- **API/CLI-Based**: EC2 Fleet can only be launched via CLI, SDKs, and APIs.

### **🚢 Spot Fleet**

A **Spot Fleet** is a collection of Spot Instances and optionally On-Demand Instances. It’s designed to `maintain` the required capacity for your application based on a Spot Instance request.

- **Maintain Target Capacity**: Spot Fleet can replace terminated Spot Instances to `maintain` the required capacity.
- **Mixed Instances**: The Spot Fleet can launch a combination of Spot and On-Demand instances.
- **Spot Capacity Pools**: Spot Fleet selects the best Spot capacity pools to meet the request specifications.

### **🚀 Spot Fleet vs EC2 Fleet**

Both Spot Fleet and EC2 Fleet allow you to launch instances across multiple AZs, but they differ in terms of flexibility and management.

## **🎯 Spot Fleet Allocation Strategy**

When setting up a Spot Fleet, you can choose one of the following strategies to determine how Spot Instances are allocated:

### 🔵 Capacity Optimized (Recommended)

- **Goal**: Ensure that the Spot instances launched meet your capacity requirements, even if the price isn’t the cheapest.
- **Best For**: Workloads that prioritize availability over cost.

### 🟢 Lowest Price

- **Goal**: Select the lowest-priced instance pools available.
- **Best For**: Cost-sensitive workloads that can tolerate fluctuations in availability.

### 🟡 Diversified

- **Goal**: Distribute Spot instances across multiple instance types to ensure availability and cost savings by reducing the risk of unavailability from any one pool.
- **Best For**: Balanced workloads that need both cost optimization and availability.

## **📋 How to Request Spot Instances**

There are two main ways to request Spot Instances:

1. **Spot Instance Request**: Launch Spot Instances within a **single Availability Zone (AZ)** or subnet.
2. **Spot Fleet Request**: Launch **multiple Spot Instances** across multiple AZs and subnets, with the option to include On-Demand Instances as well.

## **🚨 Spot Instance Interruption**

Spot Instances can be interrupted when AWS reclaims capacity. AWS provides a **2-minute warning** via:

- **Instance metadata endpoint**
- **Amazon EventBridge** (rebalance recommendation)

### 🔁 Interruption Handling Options

- 🛑 **Terminate** (default)
- ⏸️ **Stop** (EBS-backed only)
- 💤 **Hibernate** (EBS + supported OS only)

### 🔄 Rebalance Recommendations

Use EventBridge to respond proactively to interruption signals and rebalance workloads.

## ✅ Summary: Why Use Spot?

| Advantage                    | Trade-Off                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 💸 Up to 90% Cost Savings    | ⚠️ Can be interrupted anytime     |
| ♻️ Flexible Fleet Management | 🧠 Requires interruption handling |
| ⚙️ Integrates with EC2 Tools | ❌ No guaranteed availability     |

Spot Instances are powerful when used wisely. **Design for fault tolerance**, use **relaunch strategies**, and monitor **interrupt signals** to make the most of AWS’s discounted compute capacity.
