# **EC2 Fundamental**

> _"Your virtual computer in the cloud ‚Äî scalable, flexible, and powerful."_

---

An **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance** is a **virtual server** running in AWS. It provides **resizable compute capacity**, allowing you to run apps and workloads **without managing physical hardware**.

üîß You choose:

- The **OS** (Linux, Windows, or custom AMI)
- The **instance type** (CPU, RAM, storage)
- The **storage type** (temporary or persistent)

Each EC2 instance behaves like a real server ‚Äî but it's **provisioned in seconds** from AWS data centers.

## üîß **Key Components of an EC2 Instance**

| Component        | Role                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **vCPUs**        | Virtual CPUs (mapped to threads of the physical CPU)               |
| **Memory (RAM)** | Memory allocated to the instance                                   |
| **Storage**      | Either **EBS** (persistent) or **Instance Store** (ephemeral)      |
| **Networking**   | Connects via ENIs with **private**, **public**, or **Elastic IPs** |

## üíæ **Storage Options in EC2**

### üßä Instance Store (Ephemeral)

- Tied to **physical host**
- **Very fast** but **non-persistent**
- Good for: **caching**, **temporary data**, **distributed systems**
- If the instance stops, **data is lost**

> üî• Instance Store-backed EC2 = root volume on instance storage

### üì¶ EBS (Elastic Block Store)

- **Network-attached persistent volume**
- Survives **instance stop/reboot**
- Used for: **OS**, **apps**, **databases**, **backups**

> üí° EBS-backed EC2 = root volume on EBS

## üåê **EC2 IP Address Types**

| IP Type        | Internet Routable | Dynamic   | Released on Stop | Sticky | Chargeable |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| **Private IP** | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes    | ‚ùå No            | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No      |
| **Public IP**  | ‚úÖ Yes            | ‚úÖ Yes    | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚ùå No  | ‚ùå No      |

## **üíæ Relationship Between EC2 and EBS**

**Amazon EBS** is a **scalable** and **persistent block storage** service that provides **durable** storage for EC2 instances. It is designed to store **operating system files**, application data, and other files that need to persist beyond the life of the instance.

### ü§î **Why EC2 Needs EBS (Not Just Instance Storage)**

| Reason               | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Persistence**      | Data survives **stop/terminate/reboot**                                     |
| **Modularity**       | You can **detach/attach** volumes between instances                         |
| **Backup & Restore** | EBS volumes support **snapshots**, which allow **versioned backup**         |
| **Scalability**      | EBS volumes can grow in **size** and **IOPS** without stopping the instance |
| **Separation**       | Compute and storage are **independent** ‚Äî better scaling, isolation         |

### **üîó How AWS Connects EC2 and EBS in the Background**

In AWS, **EC2 instances** and **EBS volumes** are connected in the background through the **AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)** service. When you launch an EC2 instance, it is **linked to an EBS volume** to provide persistent storage. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Creation of EBS Volume**:

  - When an EC2 instance is launched, you can specify an **EBS volume** as the root device or additional volumes for storage.
  - AWS uses **EBS APIs** to create and allocate storage resources, and these volumes are automatically associated with the instance.

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Attachment Process**:

  - Once the instance is launched, AWS attaches the **EBS volume** to the instance over the **network** (using the **Elastic Block Store protocol**).
  - The volume is then **mounted** as a **block device** within the instance's operating system, allowing it to be used for file storage, databases, or application data.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Flow**:

  - All **read and write** operations to the volume happen over the **AWS network** using the **EBS protocol**. The data is stored on **physical disk** located within an AWS data center.
  - EBS provides **durability** by replicating data across multiple servers within the **availability zone**, ensuring **data persistence** even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Scaling**:
  - As EC2 instances scale, the **EBS volume** can also scale (in size and performance), ensuring that the attached storage meets the growing demands of the application.
