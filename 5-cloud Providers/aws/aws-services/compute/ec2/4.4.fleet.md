# 💼 **Fleet** Mean in EC2?

In the context of **Amazon EC2**, a **fleet** refers to a **group of EC2 instances**—not just one instance—that are launched and managed together to meet a specified **target capacity** using **a mix of instance types**, **purchase options**, and **availability zones**.

Think of it like this:

> 🔧 Instead of managing one EC2 instance at a time, you define a _plan_ (the fleet), and AWS intelligently provisions the best combination of instances to meet your needs.

## 🎯 Why Use a Fleet?

- Automatically **distributes** your workloads across:
  - Spot & On-Demand Instances
  - Multiple instance types (e.g., `c5.large`, `m5.large`)
  - Multiple Availability Zones (AZs)
- Optimizes for **cost**, **availability**, or **performance** using strategies like:
  - `lowest price`
  - `capacity-optimized`
  - `diversified`

## 🚀 Two Main Fleet Types

| Fleet Type     | Description                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Spot Fleet** | Focuses on Spot Instances (can include On-Demand). Helps maintain capacity.                                                                |
| **EC2 Fleet**  | More flexible. Supports Spot, On-Demand, and Reserved Instances + features like launch templates, pricing caps, and capacity reservations. |

## 🧠 Analogy

> Imagine you're organizing a fleet of delivery vehicles (EC2 instances).  
> You don't care _which_ exact model (instance type) or which _garage_ (AZ) the trucks come from—  
> You just want **20 trucks** (target capacity) delivered **cheaply** or **reliably**, depending on your strategy.
