### **3️⃣ Volume Gateway 💾**

The **Volume Gateway** presents block storage volumes to your on-premises apps using the iSCSI protocol. It acts like a local disk but the underlying data can be either stored locally or in the cloud, depending on the configuration.

Volume Gateway supports two configurations:

#### **📌 1. Stored Volume** _"Store First, Backup to Cloud"_

<div align="center" style="padding: 0 80px;">
    <img src="images/stored-volume.png" alt="Stored Volume" style="border-radius: 10px;"/>
</div>

**Stored Volume** configuration stores primary data on-premises block storage volumes while asynchronously backing up point-in-time snapshots to Amazon S3.

##### **🔑 Key Features:**

- Data is stored locally and accessed with low latency
- Uses iSCSI to expose block volumes to applications
- Takes point-in-time snapshots and stores them in Amazon S3
- Can be deployed on-premises or in EC2 for edge scenarios

##### **🏷️ Ideal When:**

- You need fast access to data locally
- You want to keep using your current storage, but add cloud backup
- You're preparing for disaster recovery or compliance snapshots

#### **📌 2. Cached Volume** _"Cloud First, Cache Locally"_

<div align="center" style="padding: 0 80px;">
    <img src="images/cached-volume.png" alt="Cached Volume" style="border-radius: 10px;"/>
</div>

**Cached Volume** configuration uses Amazon S3 as the primary storage for your block volumes while retaining frequently accessed data on-premises for low-latency access.

##### **🔑 Key Features:**

- Uses **S3 as a block storage** with **virtual volumes in S3**.
- Frequently accessed data is **cached locally on-premises**.
- Exposed as iSCSI volumes to local applications
- Supports snapshots for backups or restore

##### **🏷️ Ideal When:**

- You want to minimize local storage hardware
- You’re slowly migrating to the cloud
- You want scalable block storage but with fast access to hot data
