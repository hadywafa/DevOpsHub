## ⚙️ **How to Set It Up**

### 1️⃣ **Create an S3 Bucket**

- Name the bucket exactly as your domain (e.g. `www.example.com`)
- Choose the AWS Region closest to your users

### 2️⃣ **Enable Static Website Hosting**

- Navigate to **Bucket → Properties → Static Website Hosting**
- Choose **Enable**
- Set:
  - `index.html` as **Index Document**
  - `error.html` as **Error Document**

### 3️⃣ **Upload Website Files**

- Upload your HTML, CSS, JS, and media files
- Make sure all files are **publicly accessible**

### 4️⃣ **Make Files Public (Permissions)**

#### 🛡️ **Bucket Policy to Allow Public Read**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Replace `your-bucket-name` with your actual bucket name
- Apply this under **Bucket → Permissions → Bucket Policy**

### 5️⃣ **(Optional) Use a Custom Domain with HTTPS**

#### 🔗 **Integrate with Amazon CloudFront**

- Create a **CloudFront distribution** with S3 as the origin
- Use **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** to create an SSL certificate
- Point your **Route 53 records** to CloudFront

## 🧰 **Extra Tips & Alternatives**

### 🛑 **S3 Endpoint Doesn’t Support HTTPS**

- Use CloudFront in front of S3 to enable **HTTPS + caching**

### 🌐 **Custom Redirect Rules**

- Configure redirects via **Static Website Hosting → Routing Rules**
- Useful for vanity URLs, domain redirects, or handling moved pages

### 🚀 **Consider AWS Amplify**

- For CI/CD + static hosting, **Amplify Hosting** offers build, deploy, and custom domains with HTTPS support
- Great for React, Angular, Vue, static blogs, and JAMstack apps
