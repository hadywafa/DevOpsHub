---

## **2️⃣ Infrequent Access**

### 🔵 **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)**

#### **Description:**

S3 Standard-IA is optimized for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed.

#### **Features:**

- **🔒 Durability:** 99.999999999% durability.
- **⚡ Availability:** 99.9% availability within a multi AZ.
- **💲 Lower Storage Costs:** Reduced cost compared to S3 Standard for infrequently accessed data.
- **💾 Retrieval Fee:** Charges apply for data retrieval (per GB).
- **📅 Minimum Storage Duration:** 30 days.
- **📂 Use Cases:**
  - Backup and disaster recovery
  - Long-term data storage
  - Archival data that needs occasional access

#### **Notes:**

- **Real-Time Access:** Provides real-time instant access to data.
- **Durability and Availability:** S3 Standard-IA offers the same durability as S3 One Zone-IA.
- **Minimum Storage Duration:** Objects deleted before 30 days incur a 30-day charge.
- **Cost Considerations:** AWS charges for requests and data retrievals.

---

### 🟡 **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)**

#### **Description:**

S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone (AZ), offering lower costs for infrequently accessed data that does not require multi-AZ resilience.

#### **Features:**

- **🔒 Durability:** 99.999999999% durability within a single AZ.
- **⚡ Availability:** 99.5% availability.
- **💲 Cost Savings:** Lower storage costs compared to S3 Standard-IA.
- **💾 Retrieval Fee:** Charges apply for data retrieval (per GB).
- **📅 Minimum Storage Duration:** 30 days.
- **📂 Use Cases:**
  - Secondary backups
  - Data easily reproducible
  - Storing non-critical, infrequently accessed data

#### **Notes:**

- **Same Durability:** One Zone-IA maintains the same durability as S3 Standard-IA but within a single AZ.
- **Availability and Resilience:** Offers less availability and resilience compared to S3 Standard-IA due to single AZ storage.
- **Minimum Storage Duration:** Similar to S3 Standard-IA, objects deleted before 30 days incur a 30-day charge.

## **3️⃣ Intelligent-Access**

### 🟣 **Intelligent-Tiering**

#### **Description:**

S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves data between access tiers based on changing access patterns, optimizing costs without performance impact.

#### **Features:**

- **🔄 Automatic Tiering:** Seamlessly transitions objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers.
- **📊 Monitoring and Automation:** Continuously monitors access patterns and adjusts storage class accordingly.
- **💲 Cost-Effective:** Reduces costs for data with unpredictable or changing access patterns.
- **💸 No Retrieval Fees:** Eliminates additional costs for data retrieval.
- **📂 Use Cases:**
  - Data lakes
  - Data analytics
  - New applications with unknown or changing access patterns

#### **Consideration**

- **Monitoring Fee:** AWS charges a small monthly fee for monitoring and automation.
- **re-access behavior:** If the data is accessed again, it gets moved back to the Frequent Access Tier.
- **Archive Access Tiers:**
  - **Archive Access Tier:** Bypasses the Archive Instant Access Tier, similar to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class.
  - **Deep Archive Access Tier:** Moves objects not accessed for a configurable period (default 180 days) to the S3 Glacier Deep Archive class.
  - **Retrieval Time:** Both Archive and Deep Archive Access Tiers require retrieval time when accessing data.

#### **How it Works**

- If Archive Tiering not Enabled
