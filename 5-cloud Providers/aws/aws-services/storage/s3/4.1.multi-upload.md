## üöÄ **Benefits**

- **Improved Throughput:** Upload parts in parallel to maximize the use of available bandwidth, significantly speeding up the upload process.

- **Quick Recovery from Network Issues:** If a part fails to upload, only that specific part needs to be retried, not the entire object, ensuring efficient recovery from interruptions.

- **Pause and Resume Uploads:** Flexibility to pause uploads and resume them later without losing progress, allowing for better management of long-running uploads.

- **Early Assembly of Objects:** Begin assembling the final object while parts are still being uploaded, optimizing storage and processing resources.
