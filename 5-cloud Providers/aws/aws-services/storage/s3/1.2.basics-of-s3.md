## 🌟 Why Use S3?

- 📦 **Unlimited Storage**: No limits — store gigabytes or petabytes.
- 📂 **Flexible Object Sizes**: Upload anything from a **few bytes to 5TB**.
- 🛠️ **Fully Managed**: You don’t manage servers or disks.
- ⚡ **Highly Durable**: **11 nines** (99.999999999%) durability.

## 🪣 What’s a Bucket?

Buckets are your **logical containers** for storing objects in S3.

- 🌍 **Region-Specific**: Buckets exist in one region.
- 🔒 **Owned by Your AWS Account**.
- 📁 Think of them like cloud folders — but way more scalable.

---

## 🔐 Access & Ownership

- 🧾 **Bucket Ownership**: Can’t transfer, but you can share access.
- 🚪 **Public or Private**: You control object and bucket-level permissions.
- 🌐 **No VPC Needed**: S3 is publicly accessible (unless you restrict it).

---

## 🔄 Durability & Redundancy

S3 stores **multiple copies across Availability Zones (AZs)**:

- 🛡️ Automatically replicates data in **multiple facilities**.
- 🧬 Prevents single point of failure.

---

## 🔍 How to Access an S3 Object

Every object in S3 is identified by a **unique key** and accessed via URL:

- **Service Endpoint** → `https://s3.amazonaws.com`
- **Bucket Name** → e.g., `my-app-assets`
- **Object Key** → e.g., `profile-pic.jpg`
- **Version ID** → (if versioning is enabled)

📌 Example:

```ini
https://my-app-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-pic.jpg
```
