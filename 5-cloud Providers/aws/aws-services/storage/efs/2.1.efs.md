# 🗄️ **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)**

Amazon **Elastic File System (EFS)** is a fully managed, serverless, highly available, and scalable file storage service designed for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. EFS provides a simple, scalable, and elastic file system that grows and shrinks automatically as you add and remove files, eliminating the need to manage storage infrastructure.

## 🔗 **EFS File System Access**

EFS file systems are accessed using **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)**, also known as **Mount Targets**, which facilitate connectivity between your applications and the EFS file system.

### 🛠️ **Access Configuration:**

- **One ENI per AZ:** It is recommended to have one ENI per Availability Zone to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Security Groups:** Associate security groups with mount targets to control access and enhance security.
- **Mount Options:**
  - **AWS Services:** Mount EFS on Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon ECS tasks.
  - **On-Premises Servers:** Access EFS from on-premises environments through AWS Direct Connect or VPN.
  - **Peered VPCs:** Mount EFS across peered VPCs using Transit Gateway or VPC Peering for seamless access.

## 🔐 **Security Considerations for Amazon EFS**

When setting up Amazon EFS, it's essential to configure security groups and network settings correctly to ensure secure and functional access. Here are some key points:

### 📜 **Security Group Configuration**

1. **Create a Security Group**:

   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the **EC2** Dashboard.
   - Select **Security Groups** under **Network & Security**.

2. **Add Inbound Rules for EFS ENI**:

   - **NFS Traffic**: Open port `2049` for NFS traffic.
   - **Example Configuration**:

     ```sh
     Inbound Rule:
     Type: Custom TCP
     Port Range: 2049
     Source: <IP Range or Security Group>
     ```

   - **Crucial Note**: Opening port `2049` inbound for the security group of EFS ENI is crucial to allow NFS traffic.

3. **Add Outbound Rules for EC2 Instances**:

   - **NFS Traffic**: Open port `2049` for outbound NFS traffic from EC2 instances.
   - **Example Configuration**:

     ```sh
     Outbound Rule:
     Type: Custom TCP
     Port Range: 2049
     Destination: <EFS Security Group>
     ```

   - **Crucial Note**: Configuring outbound port `2049` for the EC2 instances' security group is essential to allow communication with the EFS ENI.

### 🖧 **Mounting EFS on EC2 Instances**

1. **Install NFS Client**:

   - Ensure that the NFS client package is installed on your EC2 instances. For Amazon Linux, use:

     ```sh
     sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
     ```

   - For Ubuntu, use:

     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install -y nfs-common
     ```

2. **Mount the File System**:

   - Use the following command to mount the EFS file system:

     ```sh
     sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1 <file-system-id>.efs.<region>.amazonaws.com:/ /mnt/efs
     ```

   - Replace `<file-system-id>` with your EFS file system ID and `<region>` with your AWS region.
