## 💡 **Example: How a Windows File Server Works**

Imagine you have a small office:

- All employees need to access shared documents 📂
- You don’t want files spread across 20 PCs 💻
- So, you install **Windows Server** on a central machine
- Create **shared folders** with permissions 🔒
- Employees connect using the **SMB protocol** (built-in to Windows/Mac/Linux)

Now all files are:

- **Backed up**
- **Centrally managed**
- **Secured by user/group permissions**

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GUI (Desktop) | Full desktop experience like Windows 10 — easy for beginners             |
| Core          | Minimal UI — managed remotely or via PowerShell for security/performance |
