# ⚡ **Amazon FSx for Lustre**

Amazon **FSx for Lustre** is your go-to solution when you need blazing-fast, parallel-access file storage for compute-heavy tasks like machine learning, big data analytics, media rendering, and scientific simulations. It's built on the open-source **Lustre** file system, widely used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments—and AWS makes it fully managed and cloud-integrated.

---

## 🧠 What Is Lustre? (Quick Intro)

**Lustre** is a parallel file system designed for high throughput and low latency. It lets **multiple compute nodes read and write** to the same file system concurrently—without bottlenecks.

> _Think of Lustre like a racetrack where hundreds of racecars (compute nodes) can race at the same time without colliding._

## 🔗 S3 Integration Explained

FSx for Lustre can **import objects from S3** and **export results back to S3**, enabling ultra-fast, short-lived data processing jobs that don’t require persistent file storage.

### Example:

1. Import training data from S3 to FSx for Lustre
2. Train your ML model on EC2 GPU instances
3. Export the results (e.g., trained model) back to S3

No need to manually sync—it happens transparently!

---

## 🛠️ Deployment Modes

### 🟢 Scratch File Systems

- Best for: short-lived, temp data (no durability)
- ✅ High throughput
- ❌ No backup or replication

### 🔵 Persistent File Systems

- Best for: long-term workloads
- ✅ Replicated within AZ
- ✅ Daily backups enabled

---

## 🖧 How to Use FSx for Lustre

### 1. Create File System

- Console or AWS CLI
- Optionally link to S3 bucket

### 2. Launch EC2 Instance

- In the same VPC and subnet as the FSx ENI

### 3. Install Lustre Client

```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lustre2.10
```

### 4. Mount File System

```bash
sudo mount -t lustre <fsx-dns-name>@tcp:/fsx /mnt/fsx
```

## 🔐 Security and Access Control

- Use **security groups** to allow traffic on **TCP port 988**
- Enable **IAM policies** for granular access control
- Supports **encryption at rest** with AWS KMS
- Integrates with **CloudTrail** and **CloudWatch** for audit and monitoring

---

## 📊 Monitoring and Backups

- **CloudWatch:** Real-time performance metrics
- **AWS Backup:** File-system-consistent, incremental backups
- **Events:** CloudTrail logs every API call for full visibility
