</div>

### 🛠️ **Access Configuration:**

- **ENIs and Security Groups:**
  - Each FSx for Lustre file system creates an ENI in your VPC.
  - Associate security groups with mount targets to control access and enhance security.
- **Client Access:**
  - Accessible from AWS services like EC2, ECS, and EKS instances.
  - Can also be accessed from on-premises servers via AWS Direct Connect or VPN connections.
- **Short-Term Workloads:**
  - Optimized for temporary, compute-intensive tasks. For long-term storage, integrate with durable storage solutions like Amazon S3.

## 🔄 **Deployment Modes**

Choose the deployment mode that best fits your workload requirements and cost considerations.

### 🟢 **1. Scratch File System (Single AZ)**

- **Cost-Effective:** Lowest cost option, ideal for temporary data storage.
- **Short-Term Processing:** Designed for transient workloads without the need for data persistence.
- **No Backups or Replication:** Data is not backed up or replicated, making it unsuitable for long-term storage.

### 🔵 **2. Persistent File System (Single AZ)**

- **Higher Availability:** Designed for longer-term data storage with high availability within a single AZ.
- **Data Replication:** Data and metadata are replicated within the AZ for durability.
- **Automated Backups:** Supports daily automated backups to ensure data protection.

## 🪣 S3 Integration Explained

FSx for Lustre can **import objects from S3** and **export results back to S3**, enabling ultra-fast, short-lived data processing jobs that don’t require persistent file storage.

### Example

1. Import training data from S3 to FSx for Lustre
2. Train your ML model on EC2 GPU instances
3. Export the results (e.g., trained model) back to S3

No need to manually sync—it happens transparently!

## 🖧 How to Use FSx for Lustre

### 1. Create File System

- Console or AWS CLI
- Optionally link to S3 bucket

### 2. Launch EC2 Instance

- In the same VPC and subnet as the FSx ENI

### 3. Install Lustre Client

```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lustre2.10
```

### 4. Mount File System

```bash
sudo mount -t lustre <fsx-dns-name>@tcp:/fsx /mnt/fsx
```
