## 📏 **How to Determine If You Need the Snow Family**

Understanding your data transfer and edge computing needs is crucial in deciding whether to use Snow Family services or rely on network-based transfers. Here’s a quick reference guide:

### 📊 **Data Transfer Metrics**

- **1 Exabyte (EB) = 1,000 Petabytes (PB)**
- **1 Petabyte (PB) = 1,000 Terabytes (TB)**
- **1 Terabyte (TB) = 1,000 Gigabytes (GB)**
- **1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1,000 Megabytes (MB)**
- **1 Byte = 8 Bits**

### ⚡ **Transfer Speed Estimates**

- **100 Mbps (Megabits per second) Link:**

  - **Per Hour:** 45 GB
  - **Per Day:** 1.08 TB

- **1 Gbps (Gigabit per second) Link:**
  - **Per Hour:** 450 GB
  - **Per Day:** 10.8 TB

### 🧠 **Rule of Thumb**
