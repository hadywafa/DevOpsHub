## 🤔 What is **Key Rotation**?

It just means:

> **Changing the lock (key) regularly** so it’s harder for anyone to break in.

In AWS KMS, it means **replacing the key material** used to encrypt and decrypt stuff — but you **keep using the same key name/ID**.

---

### 🛠️ Why do it?

- **Better security** — old keys could be weaker if used too long.
- **Some rules (compliance)** require it.

---

### 🔄 Two ways to rotate keys

1. **Automatic rotation (easy mode)**  
   AWS does it for you **once a year** for **customer-managed keys**. You just turn it on.

2. **Manual rotation (DIY mode)**  
   You make a **new key**, and start using it yourself.

---

### 📦 Important

- You **can still unlock old data** because AWS keeps old versions of the key behind the scenes.
- You don’t lose access to your data!

---

Think of it like:

> You change the _door lock mechanism_, but your _key label_ stays the same.
