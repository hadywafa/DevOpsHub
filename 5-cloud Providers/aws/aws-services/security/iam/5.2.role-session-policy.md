# 🕐 **Session Policy in AWS IAM**

_Restrict what a user or service can do **during a specific temporary session**_

---

## 📌 **What is a Session Policy?**

A **Session Policy** is a **temporary policy** that you attach to an IAM session **at the time of assuming a role or federating a user**.

> 🧠 **Think of it like this**:  
> A role might give full access to S3, but **you can restrict that session to only `GetObject` on one specific bucket**—without changing the role's base policy!

---

### 🧷 **Where Are Session Policies Used?**

| 💬 Use Case                    | Example                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧑 Assume a Role               | Use `aws sts assume-role` and pass a session policy       |
| 🌐 Federated Users             | Apply session policy to restrict permissions during login |
| 🔐 Temporary Credentials (STS) | Add limits when requesting short-lived credentials        |

## 🧠 First, the Core Difference

| 📌 Concept          | 🧾 Role Policy (Attached Policy)          | 🕐 Session Policy (Passed Temporarily)                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attached To**     | Attached directly to the IAM **role**     | Passed during `AssumeRole` or `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`            |
| **Persistence**     | Permanent until explicitly updated        | Temporary, only lasts for the **duration of the session**            |
| **Grants Power?**   | ✅ Yes – defines what the role **can** do | ❌ No – **limits** what the session is allowed to do                 |
| **Use Case**        | Define base permissions for a role        | Temporarily restrict access for a specific session or federated user |
| **Who Defines It?** | Admins define in IAM                      | The user or service calling `AssumeRole` provides it                 |

## 🔄 **How Do Session Policies Work?**

When someone assumes a role or requests temporary credentials:

1. You can pass an **inline policy** as a session policy.
2. AWS **intersects this policy** with the base permissions of the role/user.
3. The final **effective permissions** are:

```text
Final Permissions = IAM Policies ∩ Resource Policies ∩ Session Policy
```

✅ **Result**: Even if the IAM policy is broad, the session can be **narrowed down** temporarily.

## 🧪 **Use Cases of Session Policies**

| 🛠️ Scenario                                 | 🔒 What the Session Policy Does                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A developer needs temporary access to S3    | Limits them to just one bucket and `GetObject` for that session only   |
| Federated user logs in from an external IdP | Limits actions during their SSO session, such as read-only EC2         |
| Temporary team task                         | Restrict a role session to perform just what’s needed and nothing more |

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Example: Session Policy with AssumeRole**

### 🎯 Goal

A user assumes a role with full S3 access, but we want to **restrict** the session to **only `GetObject` on one bucket**.

---

### 1️⃣ **S3AccessTrustRole - Trust Role**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2️⃣ **S3AccessRolePolicy - Base Role Policy** (Full S3 access)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

🧠 This is the role’s default permission—**very powerful**.

---

### 3️⃣ **Assume the Role with the Session Policy**

```bash
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:role/ExampleRole \
  --role-session-name S3AccessRoleSessionPolicy \
  --policy '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

🧠 This command:

- Assumes the `S3AccessTrustRole`
- Names the session `S3AccessRoleSessionPolicy`
- Applies the above session policy

✅ Even though the role allows all `s3:*`, this session will be **limited to `s3:GetObject` on `example-bucket/*` only**.

---

## 🚫 **Limitations of Session Policies**

1. **Cannot grant new permissions**

   > They can only **reduce** what’s already granted. If the base policy doesn’t allow it, the session policy can’t override it.

2. **Evaluated with other policies**

   > Final permissions = **intersection** of:

   - IAM identity policy
   - Resource policy (if any)
   - Session policy

3. **Policy size limits apply**
   > Max size for session policy is 2048 characters (for inline JSON string).

---

## 🛠️ What Happens Internally?

```text
FINAL SESSION PERMISSIONS
= ROLE POLICY ∩ SESSION POLICY
= (s3:*) ∩ (s3:GetObject on logs-team-a)
= ONLY s3:GetObject on logs-team-a/*
```

## ✅ **Benefits of Session Policies**

| ✅ Benefit              | 💬 Why It Helps                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔐 **Least privilege**  | Helps enforce task-specific access—even on highly privileged roles |
| 🧪 **Safe testing**     | Test limited capabilities without changing real IAM policies       |
| 🔄 **Temporary only**   | Limits vanish when the session expires—no long-term risk           |
| 🛠️ **Granular control** | Control what federated or assumed identities can do per session    |

## ❗ Common Misunderstandings

| Myth                                   | Truth                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Session policy gives new permissions" | ❌ False – it only **restricts**. It can’t give more than the base role |
| "It's a replacement for IAM policies"  | ❌ False – it works **on top of** role/user policies                    |
| "It modifies the role itself"          | ❌ No – it only applies for that single session                         |

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature             | Description                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Temporary        | Applies only during session (e.g. AssumeRole, federation)              |
| ❌ Doesn’t Grant    | Cannot grant more permissions—only restrict existing ones              |
| 🔐 Used For         | Secure one-time scripts, federated users, limited pipeline runs        |
| ⚙️ How It Works     | Evaluated as: `final = base_policy ∩ session_policy`                   |
| 🛑 Use with caution | Always test first—if too restrictive, you might block required actions |
