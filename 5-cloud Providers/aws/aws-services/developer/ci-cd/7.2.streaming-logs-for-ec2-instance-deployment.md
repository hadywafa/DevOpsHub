# 📡 7.2. **Streaming Deployment Logs for EC2 Instance Deployments with AWS CodeDeploy**

> Learn how to access and **centralize CodeDeploy logs** — either by viewing them directly on the EC2 instance or streaming them to **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** for real-time monitoring at scale.

---

## 🗃️ 1. Where CodeDeploy Logs Are Stored (On EC2)

Once CodeDeploy is used to deploy an application to EC2, the **CodeDeploy Agent** running on the instance saves all deployment activity to this folder:

```ini
/opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/
```

It includes:

| Path                                                                | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/deployment-root/deployment-logs/codedeploy-agent-deployments.log` | 🪵 **Main log file** for all deployments (stderr + stdout) |
| `/deployment-root/<deployment-group-id>/<deployment-id>/archive/`   | 📦 Deployed artifact + `appspec.yml`, scripts             |
| `/deployment-root/<deployment-group-id>/<deployment-id>/logs/`      | 📃 Logs specific to **that deployment**                   |

---

## 🔍 2. Viewing Deployment Logs on the EC2 Instance

### 🔹 Step-by-Step

1. **Connect to your EC2 instance:**

   Via SSH or EC2 Instance Connect.

2. **Navigate to the logs:**

   ```bash
   cd /opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/deployment-logs
   ls -la
   ```

3. **Read the deployment log:**

   ```bash
   less codedeploy-agent-deployments.log
   ```

   > Each section in this file shows:
   >
   > - Timestamp 🕒
   > - Deployment ID 🆔
   > - Lifecycle event (e.g., `ApplicationStart`)
   > - Executed script path
   > - Output or errors from the script

4. **Access logs per deployment:**

   ```bash
   cd /opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/<deployment-group-id>/<deployment-id>/
   ```

   Check:

   - `archive/` – Contains full artifact content (dist/, appspec.yml, etc.)
   - `logs/scripts.log` – Logs **specific to that deployment only**

   ```bash
   less logs/scripts.log
   ```

   > ✅ This method is great for debugging individual deployments.

## 🌐 3. Why Stream Logs to CloudWatch?

### 💡 Imagine You Have

- Dozens of EC2 instances
- Auto Scaling groups (instances terminate after scale-in)
- Failures that need centralized visibility

👉 You **shouldn’t** have to SSH into each instance.

### ✅ Benefits of CloudWatch Logs

| Feature                      | Benefit                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🔎 Centralized visibility    | View logs from all instances in one place  |
| ⏱️ Real-time monitoring      | Watch logs as deployments happen           |
| 📉 Historical logs           | Don't lose logs when instances are deleted |
| 📡 Cross-service integration | Use logs in alarms, dashboards, or Lambda  |

---

## 🔐 4. Granting Permissions to Send Logs

You must attach the following **managed policy** to your EC2 instance’s IAM role:

```bash
CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy
```

> 📍 Go to EC2 → Instance → IAM Role → Attach Policies → Search and add it.

---

## ⬇️ 5. Installing the CloudWatch Agent

Connect to your EC2 instance, then run:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/amazon_linux/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
sudo rpm -U ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
```

> ✅ This installs the agent and creates the `cwagent` user/group.

---

## 🧙 6. Configuring CloudWatch Agent (Wizard Mode)

Use the interactive wizard to configure log streaming:

```bash
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
```

## 📤 7. Start CloudWatch Agent with Config File

Use the following command to start streaming:

```bash
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
-a fetch-config \
-m ec2 \
-c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json \
-s
```

### (Optional) Add Timestamp Format

In your config JSON file (opened with `sudo nano`):

```json
"timestamp_format": "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
```

This ensures correct timestamp rendering in CloudWatch.

---

## ✅ 8. Verifying in CloudWatch Console

1. Go to **CloudWatch → Logs → Log Groups**
2. Find log group named:

   ```ini
   /opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/deployment-logs/codedeploy-agent-deployments.log
   ```

3. Inside, you’ll see **log streams** per instance (named by instance ID)

4. Click on a stream → view real-time logs

> 🔍 You’ll see exact lifecycle logs and script output, just like on the EC2 terminal.
