# 🔄 AWS CodePipeline: Source Actions & Change Detection (2025 Update)

In this guide, you'll master the **Source Stage** of **AWS CodePipeline**, focusing on:

1. 🔹 First-Party Source Providers
2. 🌐 Third-Party Source Providers via **AWS CodeConnections**
3. 🔄 Change Detection Methods
4. 🎛️ Trigger Filters & Best Practices

---

## 🧩 1. First-Party Source Providers (Native to AWS)

These are **AWS-native services** with seamless integration into CodePipeline.

### ✅ Supported Providers

- **Amazon S3**
- **AWS CodeCommit**
- **Amazon ECR**

### 🔄 Change Detection Methods

| Provider       | Change Detection             | Description                                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon S3**  | **EventBridge + CloudTrail** | Requires both services. Triggers when an object is uploaded or updated.   |
| **CodeCommit** | **EventBridge**              | Triggers on commits or branch/tag changes. No manual setup required.      |
| **Amazon ECR** | **EventBridge**              | Triggers when a new image is pushed. Great for container build pipelines. |

> 💡 **Note**: When using the **AWS Console**, EventBridge rules are auto-created. For **CLI** or **CloudFormation**, manual setup is required.

## 🌐 2. Third-Party Providers via AWS CodeConnections

**AWS CodeConnections** provides secure and OAuth-based connections to **external code repositories**.

### ✅ Supported Providers

- GitHub.com
- GitHub Enterprise (Cloud & Server)
- Bitbucket Cloud
- GitLab.com
- GitLab Self-Managed

### 🔄 Change Detection

| Provider                    | Detection Method             | Notes                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub.com / Enterprise** | Webhooks via CodeConnections | Uses GitHub Apps under the hood.                                     |
| **Bitbucket Cloud**         | Webhooks via CodeConnections | Bitbucket Server is **not** supported.                               |
| **GitLab (Cloud + Self)**   | Webhooks via CodeConnections | Self-managed GitLab requires manual host connection and trust setup. |

> 🛠️ **CodeConnections** automatically sets up and manages webhooks for all supported providers.

## 🔁 3. Change Detection Methods – Overview

| Method                           | Description                                          | Used By                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **EventBridge**                  | Real-time, native AWS event-based trigger            | S3, CodeCommit, ECR                |
| **Webhooks via CodeConnections** | Secure, real-time, webhook-based detection via OAuth | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket          |
| **Polling**                      | Periodic polling (inefficient and deprecated)        | Previously used for S3, CodeCommit |
| **Manual Trigger**               | Run pipeline manually via console, CLI, or SDK       | All source providers               |

> ⚠️ **Avoid Polling**: Webhooks and EventBridge are preferred for modern CI/CD pipelines.

## 🎛️ 4. Trigger Filters & Best Practices

For **third-party providers** using **CodeConnections**, you can fine-tune when your pipeline triggers.

### 🔍 Supported Trigger Filters

| Filter Type             | Description                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No Filter**           | Triggers on **any push** to the selected branch.                      |
| **Branch Filters**      | Trigger pipeline **only for specific branches**.                      |
| **Tag Filters**         | Trigger based on **specific Git tags** (e.g., `v1.*`).                |
| **File Path Filters**   | Trigger only when certain files or paths are modified.                |
| **Pull Request Events** | Trigger on PR **creation**, **update**, or **merge** (GitHub/GitLab). |

> 🧠 **Important**: You can define **only one trigger filter per source action**.

## ✅ Best Practices

1. **Use EventBridge over Polling** for first-party sources for low latency & better scalability.
2. **Favor V2 Pipelines** for advanced trigger features (PR, tag, file-path filters).
3. **Avoid polling unless necessary**; migrate legacy pipelines to event-based triggers.
4. **Use revision overrides for reproducible builds** or manual re-runs.
5. **Use IAM least-privilege policies** and restrict connection usage across accounts.
