# 🎯 Full Guide: Understanding `artifacts` in `buildspec.yml` for AWS CodeDeploy

## 🏗️ What Are Artifacts in CodeBuild?

In AWS CodeBuild, **artifacts** represent the final output files generated after the build process.  
These are the files that will later be deployed by **AWS CodeDeploy** or stored somewhere like **S3** for distribution.

✅ Artifacts could include:

- Compiled binaries (`.dll`, `.exe`, etc.)
- Bundled frontend apps (`index.html`, `bundle.js`, etc.)
- ZIP packages
- Configuration files
- Any other important outputs

> 👉 The artifact definition **controls what files CodeBuild sends** to the next stage (for example, to CodeDeploy or to a manual download).

## 🛠️ Artifact Section in `buildspec.yml`

Inside your `buildspec.yml`, you define artifacts using the `artifacts` section.

Here's the basic syntax:

```yaml
artifacts:
  files:
    - <patterns to include>
  base-directory: <path to start from>
  discard-paths: <yes|no>
```

| Field            | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `files`          | Patterns of files you want to package (e.g., `**/*`, `app/**/*`, `*.zip`) |
| `base-directory` | Directory where those files are located (relative to the build root)      |
| `discard-paths`  | Whether to flatten the folder structure (`yes`) or preserve it (`no`)     |

---

## 🔥 Detailed Attribute Breakdown

### 📂 `files`

- Defines **which files** you want to include in the artifact.
- Supports wildcards (`*` and `**`).
- Example:

  ```yaml
  files:
    - "**/*" # (this includes everything)
  ```

---

### 🏠 `base-directory`

- Tells CodeBuild where to **start looking** for the files you want to package.
- If you just built your app and the output is inside `publish/`, you can set:

  ```yaml
  base-directory: publish
  ```

---

### 🧹 `discard-paths`

- **`yes`**: Flatten all files into a **single folder** — no subdirectories.
- **`no`**: Keep the **original directory structure**.

✅ `discard-paths: yes` is super helpful when:

- Deploying simple websites.
- Uploading flat ZIP packages.
- Sending all files directly to the root of an S3 bucket.

---

## 📦 Artifact + CodeDeploy Relationship

When CodeBuild finishes, it uploads the artifacts (e.g., to an S3 bucket).  
Then, **AWS CodeDeploy** picks up those artifacts and **deploys them** to your target environment (EC2, Lambda, ECS).

So, if your artifact is messed up (wrong files, missing files, broken structure), the deployment will **fail**.

That's why **setting up artifacts correctly in `buildspec.yml` is critical**!

---

## 🧩 Examples of Artifact Configurations

---

### 🧱 Example 1: Preserving Directory Structure

```yaml
artifacts:
  files:
    - "**/*"
  base-directory: publish
  discard-paths: no
```

#### ✅ Behavior

- All files inside `publish/` are included.
- The subfolder structure (e.g., `assets/`, `config/`) is **preserved**.

#### 🧠 Common Use Case

- .NET Core APIs or apps
- Node.js apps with build folders
- Java apps after Maven/Gradle builds

---

### 📂 Example 2: Flattening the Artifact (Using `discard-paths`)

```yaml
artifacts:
  files:
    - "**/*"
  base-directory: dist/my-angular-app
  discard-paths: yes
```

#### ✅ Behavior

- All files inside `dist/my-angular-app` are included.
- The directory structure is **flattened**.
- No folders — just pure files at the root.

#### 🧠 Common Use Case

- Frontend Angular/React apps being deployed to S3 buckets
- Websites for CDNs

---

## 🔍 Visual Difference: `discard-paths` On vs Off

Imagine the following files in your build folder:

```plaintext
dist/my-angular-app/
├── css/
│   ├── style.css
│   └── theme.css
├── js/
│   ├── app.js
│   └── vendor.js
└── index.html
```

---

### Without `discard-paths` (`no`)

- Result:

```plaintext
css/style.css
css/theme.css
js/app.js
js/vendor.js
index.html
```

- Structure preserved inside the artifact.

---

### With `discard-paths` (`yes`)

- Result:

```plaintext
style.css
theme.css
app.js
vendor.js
index.html
```

- Everything dumped in one flat folder!

## 🧠 Best Practices for Artifacts in CodeDeploy Pipelines

| Best Practice                        | Why                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Set `base-directory` smartly         | Avoid uploading unnecessary temp folders.                          |
| Use `discard-paths: yes` when needed | Especially when simple flat deployment is better (like websites).  |
| Always validate your artifacts       | Download the artifact manually to verify it has the correct files. |
| Secure artifacts in S3               | Use proper S3 bucket policies and encryption.                      |
| Zip artifacts if huge                | Save transfer and storage time (can be automated inside build).    |

## 📋 Mini Checklist Before Deploying Artifacts

✅ Confirm the build output is correct.  
✅ Check if you want directory structure preserved or flattened.  
✅ Match the structure to CodeDeploy's expectations (especially if you're using `appspec.yml`).  
✅ Manually test deployment once after major changes.

---

## 🚀 Final Notes

- If you're building a **backend API (.NET, Node, Java)** → Preserve paths.
- If you're building a **frontend web app (Angular, React, Vue)** → Consider flattening paths.
- Always verify what your CodeDeploy setup expects (especially if using hooks or lifecycle events).

## 📈 Quick Full Example `buildspec.yml`

Here's a small complete sample you can use:

```yaml
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      - npm run build

artifacts:
  files:
    - "**/*"
  base-directory: dist
  discard-paths: yes
```

✅ This builds a frontend app, then prepares the dist/ folder content flattened for CodeDeploy to pick it up!
