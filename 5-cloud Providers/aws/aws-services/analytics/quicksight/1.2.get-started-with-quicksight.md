# 🪜 Getting Started with Amazon QuickSight: Your First Step into Serverless BI

QuickSight is AWS's fully managed BI service that enables users—from analysts to executives—to:

- 📊 Build interactive dashboards
- 📈 Explore and analyze data visually
- 📬 Schedule reports
- 🧠 Use machine learning (ML) insights
- 🌐 Share dashboards securely via web or mobile

And the best part? **No software to install**. It’s all browser-based and **serverless**, which means it scales automatically and you pay only for what you use.

## 🧪 Who Can Use QuickSight?

There are **two types of users**:

| Type                 | Description                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IAM Users**        | AWS-native users who log in using their IAM credentials          |
| **QuickSight Users** | Managed directly in QuickSight; don't require AWS console access |

Admins can create either type, allowing external stakeholders to access dashboards **without touching the AWS Console**.

## 🎨 Creating Your First Visualization

Once inside the analysis:

## ⚡ What is SPICE?

**SPICE** = Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine  
It enables:

- 🚀 Fast visual rendering
- 📈 Smooth interactivity with large datasets
- 💰 Cost control via import instead of live queries

> You get free SPICE capacity to try it. After that, additional usage is billed.
