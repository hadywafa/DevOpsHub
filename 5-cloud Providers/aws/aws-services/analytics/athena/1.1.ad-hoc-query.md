# **🔍 What is an Ad-Hoc Query?**

## **📋 What is an Ad-Hoc Query?**

- An **ad-hoc query** is a **one-time, unplanned question** you ask a database or data source to quickly retrieve specific information.
- Unlike pre-scheduled or pre-defined reports, ad-hoc queries are created **on the spot** to answer immediate, unique questions.

💡 **Key Idea:**  
Ad-hoc queries are like asking a question out of curiosity—something you didn’t plan for in advance.

## **⚙️ Characteristics of Ad-Hoc Queries**

1. **Unplanned:**
   - Created spontaneously to solve immediate needs.
2. **Flexible:**
   - Allows users to explore data without predefined constraints.
3. **Quick:**
   - Results are generated in real-time or near real-time.

## **🌟 Why Use Ad-Hoc Queries?**

1. **Answer Immediate Questions:**
   - For example, “How many customers purchased product X today?”
2. **Explore Data:**
   - Useful for testing hypotheses or exploring trends.
3. **Solve Unique Problems:**
   - For tasks that don’t fit into regular reports or dashboards.

## **📊 Examples of Ad-Hoc Queries**

1. **Retail:**

   - Query: “What’s the total revenue generated by customers in New York this month?”
   - SQL:

     ```sql
     SELECT SUM(revenue)
     FROM sales
     WHERE location = 'New York' AND MONTH(date) = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE);
     ```

2. **Healthcare:**

   - Query: “How many patients visited for flu symptoms last week?”
   - SQL:

     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM patient_visits
     WHERE diagnosis = 'flu' AND visit_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-07';
     ```

3. **Social Media:**

   - Query: “Which hashtags were trending yesterday?”
   - SQL:

     ```sql
     SELECT hashtag, COUNT(*)
     FROM tweets
     WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE - 1
     GROUP BY hashtag
     ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
     ```

## **🌍 Real-Life Example**

**Scenario:**  
A marketing manager wants to know how many customers clicked on a specific ad in the past hour.

**Ad-Hoc Query:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM ad_clicks
WHERE ad_id = '12345' AND click_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```

**Result:**  
The query provides an instant count of clicks for that ad, helping the manager decide whether to increase or stop spending on the campaign.

## **🧠 Simple Analogy**

Think of ad-hoc queries like **Googling a specific question**:

- You don’t prepare in advance; you just ask based on your current need.
- Once you get the answer, you move on.
