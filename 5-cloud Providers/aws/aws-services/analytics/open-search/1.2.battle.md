# ðŸ¥Š **Elasticsearch and OpenSearch**

Elasticsearch and OpenSearch are both powerful tools for search and analytics, but they have distinct differences due to their origins and development paths:

1. **Origins**:

   - Elasticsearch is developed and maintained by **Elastic NV**, and it's a widely used open-source search engine.
   - OpenSearch, on the other hand, is a **community-driven, open-source fork of Elasticsearch** and Kibana created by Amazon Web Services (AWS) after Elastic changed its licensing model.

2. **Licensing**:

   - Elasticsearch moved from the open-source **Apache 2.0 license** to a dual license model (**Elastic License 2.0 and Server Side Public License**) starting from version 7.11.
   - OpenSearch remains under the **Apache 2.0 license**, ensuring it stays fully open source.

3. **Development and Community**:

   - Elasticsearch is led and controlled by Elastic NV, with contributions mainly coming from their team.
   - OpenSearch is a **community-driven project**, with contributions from multiple organizations and individuals, making it more collaborative.

4. **Features**:
   - As of their divergence, Elasticsearch has advanced features built by Elastic NV, but newer features are subject to Elastic's licensing terms.
   - OpenSearch continues to evolve independently, adding its own set of features, and is fully compatible with earlier versions of Elasticsearch (up to version 7.10).

If you're trying to choose between them, your decision might hinge on factors like licensing, features, or community preference. Are you considering using one of them for a project?
