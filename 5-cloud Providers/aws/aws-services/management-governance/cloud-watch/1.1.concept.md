# Monitoring Concepts in AWS

Monitoring in AWS plays a crucial role in ensuring the health, performance, and operational efficiency of your applications and resources. AWS offers powerful tools like **CloudWatch** for tracking metrics, collecting logs, and setting alarms to help you monitor and react to changes in your infrastructure. Understanding the core concepts of monitoring will enable you to take full advantage of these tools and optimize your environment.

## 1. **Metrics** 📊

Metrics are the foundation of monitoring in AWS. They provide quantitative data about your resources and applications, allowing you to track performance and identify potential issues.

### 1.1 **Resolution** 🔄

Metric resolution defines how frequently data points are collected for a metric.

- **Standard Resolution**: Data is collected every 1 minute.
- **High Resolution**: Data is collected every 1 second, providing more granular insights into system performance. (Additional cost applies for high-resolution metrics.)

### 1.2 **Retention Period** 📅

CloudWatch stores metric data for different durations based on the resolution:

- **1-second resolution**: Stored for 3 hours.
- **1-minute resolution**: Stored for 15 days.
- **5-minute resolution**: Stored for 63 days.
- **1-hour resolution**: Stored for 455 days (~15 months).

As data ages, it is **aggregated** and stored at a lower resolution to save on storage costs while preserving important historical data.

### 1.3 **Aggregation** 📊

As metric data ages, it is aggregated into larger intervals. This means that data points collected at high resolution (e.g., 1-second intervals) will be summarized into lower-resolution intervals (e.g., 1-minute or 1-hour intervals). This helps manage storage efficiently while maintaining useful historical data.

### 1.4 **Statistic** 📈

A statistic is an aggregation of metric data over a specific period. Common statistics include:

- **Min**: The minimum value in the time period.
- **Max**: The maximum value in the time period.
- **Sum**: The sum of the values in the time period.
- **Average (Avg)**: The average value in the time period.

These statistics help in summarizing data and making decisions based on trends.

### 1.5 **Percentile** 📊

Percentiles help in understanding how a particular metric is distributed. Common percentiles include:

- **p95**: The 95th percentile value (e.g., response time where 95% of requests are faster).
- **p99**: The 99th percentile value, representing the top 1% of data points.

Percentiles are useful for performance monitoring and setting service level objectives (SLOs).

### 1.6 **Units of Measure** 📏

Metrics can have different units of measure, such as **Seconds**, **Bytes**, **Percent**, and **Count**. Understanding the correct unit for each metric is crucial for interpreting data accurately.

## 2. **Logs** 📝

Logs are essential for tracking detailed events and activities in your AWS environment. They allow you to troubleshoot issues, monitor system behavior, and identify errors.

### 2.1 **Log Stream** 🔄

A **log stream** is a sequence of log events from the same source. For instance, each EC2 instance or Lambda function can have its own log stream.

- **Example**: For an application with three EC2 instances, you would have three log streams under a common **log group**:

  - **Log Group: ApplicationLogs**
    - **Log Stream: EC2_Instance_1**
    - **Log Stream: EC2_Instance_2**
    - **Log Stream: EC2_Instance_3**

Each stream contains log events generated by the respective EC2 instance.

### 2.2 **Log Group Retention Period** 🗓️

The retention period specifies how long logs are stored before being deleted automatically. You can set this period based on the importance and compliance requirements of the logs.

- **Retention Period Options**: From 1 day to 10 years.
- **Automatic Deletion**: Once the retention period expires, the logs are deleted automatically, helping manage storage costs.

### 2.3 **Log Insights** 🔍

**CloudWatch Logs Insights** allows you to interactively search, analyze, and visualize your logs. This feature helps you quickly identify trends, errors, or bottlenecks in your system. Logs Insights uses a powerful query language to extract meaningful information from your log data.

### 2.4 **Log Metric Filters** 🛠️

You can create **metric filters** from log data. These filters allow you to generate CloudWatch metrics based on specific patterns in your logs (e.g., error messages or request latencies). The metric data can then be used for creating alarms or dashboards.

- **Example**: Set a filter to track HTTP 500 errors from your logs and create a custom CloudWatch metric based on the number of occurrences.

## 3. **Alarms** ⏰

CloudWatch Alarms allow you to monitor metrics and take actions based on specific conditions. When a metric exceeds or falls below a defined threshold, the alarm triggers and performs actions like scaling, notifications, or instance recovery.

### 3.1 **Types of Alarms** 🛠️

- **Standard Alarms**: Monitor a single metric or a custom metric and trigger actions based on thresholds.
- **Composite Alarms**: Combine multiple alarms into one. The composite alarm triggers if any of the individual alarms cross their thresholds.

### 3.2 **Alarm States** 📉

- **OK**: The metric is within the defined threshold.
- **ALARM**: The metric has crossed the threshold for a specified number of evaluation periods.
- **INSUFFICIENT_DATA**: Not enough data points are available to evaluate the alarm.

### 3.3 **Alarm Actions** 🔧

Alarms can trigger a variety of actions:

- **Auto-scaling**: Adjust the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group based on the metric value.
- **EC2 Recovery**: Automatically restart or recover EC2 instances if a metric exceeds the threshold.
- **SNS Notifications**: Send notifications to SNS topics to alert teams or systems of the alarm state.

## 4. **Dashboards** 📊

CloudWatch Dashboards provide visual representations of your metrics and logs, allowing you to monitor the health of your AWS environment in real time. You can create custom dashboards to track the metrics that matter most to your application and business.

### 4.1 **Custom Dashboards** 🌐

- Dashboards can combine data from multiple regions and accounts.
- Metrics and logs can be visualized together, providing a comprehensive view of system health.
- Dashboards are shareable with stakeholders and can be accessed publicly or privately.

---

## 5. **Anomaly Detection** 🔎

**Anomaly detection** helps to automatically detect anomalies in metric data based on machine learning models. CloudWatch uses historical data to learn the normal behavior of a metric and alerts you when the metric deviates from this pattern.

### Benefits:

- Automatically detects unusual patterns or spikes.
- Reduces the need to manually set thresholds for metrics.
