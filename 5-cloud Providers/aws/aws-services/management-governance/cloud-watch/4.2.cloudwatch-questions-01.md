# Questions

## Metrics are collection of log event ?

No, in AWS CloudWatch, metrics and log events are distinct concepts:

- **Metrics**: These are time-ordered data points that represent the performance of AWS resources or custom applications. Metrics in CloudWatch provide quantitative information like CPU utilization, disk I/O, and network traffic for resources such as EC2 instances or RDS databases.

- **Log Events**: These are individual records of activity that are captured by CloudWatch Logs. They are typically generated by AWS resources or applications to provide more detailed, textual information (e.g., system logs, application logs, or access logs).

In summary, **metrics** are used for monitoring and analyzing numerical performance data, while **log events** provide detailed textual information about the state or actions of a system. Both can be collected and analyzed in CloudWatch but serve different purposes.

## So metrics are collection of data points ?

Yes, exactly! **Metrics** in AWS CloudWatch are collections of **data points**. Each data point represents a specific value of a metric at a given time. These data points are recorded over time and can be used to monitor and analyze the performance of AWS resources or custom applications.

For example:

- A metric like **CPU utilization** for an EC2 instance will have data points such as `CPU utilization = 45%` at `10:00 AM`, `60%` at `10:05 AM`, and so on.
- These data points are grouped together under a metric to provide insights into the performance over a specific period.

Metrics can be graphed and used for setting up alarms, but they are not logs or event records. They focus on numerical performance data, while log events capture detailed textual information.

## where single data point are stored ?

In AWS CloudWatch, **metrics** are stored and retained by default for a specific period, but they do not get deleted automatically unless you explicitly delete them.

Here’s how **CloudWatch Metrics** retention works:

- **Default Retention**: CloudWatch retains metrics for different time frames depending on their granularity:

  - **1-second granularity** metrics are stored for **3 hours**.
  - **1-minute granularity** metrics are stored for **15 days**.
  - **5-minute granularity** metrics are stored for **63 days**.
  - **1-hour granularity** metrics are stored for **455 days**.

  After these retention periods, the data points are automatically deleted. The data is not retained indefinitely unless you take further action.

- **Custom Retention for Logs**: Unlike metrics, **CloudWatch Logs** (log events) can be retained based on the **log group’s retention settings**. By default, logs are stored indefinitely, but you can set up retention policies to automatically delete logs after a certain time (e.g., 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, etc.).

So, while CloudWatch **metrics** are automatically deleted after their retention period ends, you do not need to worry about them unless you want to keep them for longer durations. For **logs**, you have more flexibility to manage retention through configuration.

## What if i need to store 1-minute granularity metrics each data point more than that 15 days?

If you need to store **1-minute granularity metrics** (or any other granularity) for **more than the default 15-day retention period**, you have a few options, although CloudWatch doesn't offer direct support for extending retention for fine-grained metrics beyond their default period.

Here are the options you can consider:

### 1. **Use CloudWatch Logs to Store Metrics Data**

You can use **CloudWatch Logs** to store custom logs that contain your metric data. You can then manage the retention of these logs manually by setting a retention policy that fits your needs. However, this approach requires you to extract your metrics as logs and may increase the complexity of your setup.

### 2. **Export Metrics to S3**

You can export CloudWatch metrics to **Amazon S3** for long-term storage. You can periodically export metrics data (such as every day, week, or month) and store them in S3 as raw files (e.g., CSV or JSON). By doing this, you can store your data as long as you want, and you can access it at any time.

- **Option for export**: AWS provides the ability to export metric data from CloudWatch to S3 using the **CloudWatch Console**, the **AWS CLI**, or programmatically with the **CloudWatch API**.

- **Automating the export**: You could create a scheduled task using **AWS Lambda** to automatically export your metrics to S3 at regular intervals.

### 3. **Use Amazon Timestream for Time Series Data**

**Amazon Timestream** is a fully managed time series database service designed for storing and analyzing time-stamped data, such as metrics from CloudWatch. It can store high-frequency data for long periods, and you can set retention policies that allow fine-grained control over data storage.

- **Integration**: You can push CloudWatch metric data to Amazon Timestream for long-term storage, and Timestream's retention policies let you keep recent data at a higher granularity while automatically downsampling older data.

## So monitoring is not design for storing lgs data it is just for track the system for specific period of time?

Yes, you are correct! **Monitoring** systems like AWS CloudWatch are generally designed to track the **current** and **historical** performance of systems over a **specific period of time**, but they are not primarily meant for **long-term data storage**.

Here’s a breakdown of what monitoring systems are designed for and why they don't keep data indefinitely:

### Purpose of Monitoring

- **Real-time tracking**: Monitoring tools like CloudWatch are meant to provide real-time insights into the health and performance of your systems, helping you detect anomalies or issues as they happen.

- **Historical analysis**: Monitoring systems store data for **a limited time** (e.g., CloudWatch's default retention periods) to allow for **historical analysis**. This data helps in identifying trends, diagnosing past issues, or comparing performance over days or weeks. The retention period is designed to balance the need for insights with the storage costs associated with keeping large amounts of data.

- **Future prediction**: Monitoring tools can also be used to predict future performance based on trends, such as through the use of **alarms** and **automated scaling** triggered by threshold values. They help prevent problems before they occur based on historical data and performance metrics.

### Why Monitoring Systems Don’t Store Data Indefinitely:

1. **Storage and cost**: Storing high-frequency (fine-grained) metrics for long periods would consume a lot of storage, leading to higher costs. Monitoring tools are designed for **temporary storage** for active, real-time monitoring and historical analysis over shorter time periods.

2. **Performance**: Storing and processing massive amounts of historical data at high granularity would impact the performance of monitoring tools. They are optimized for **current and recent past** data, not for long-term data archival.

3. **Data volume**: For fine-grained metrics like 1-minute data, the volume can become very large quickly. Keeping this data indefinitely would not only incur high costs but could also lead to inefficient storage management.

### For Long-Term Data Storage:

If you need to keep data for long periods or need access to it for compliance, auditing, or deep historical analysis, you need to **export** the data to other services designed for long-term storage, such as:

- **Amazon S3** for raw data export.
- **Amazon Timestream** for time-series data.
- **Databases like DynamoDB** or even **third-party storage systems**.

## Is the Data Point will be delete when it becomes old age or it will aggregate ?

You're absolutely right! I apologize for the confusion. The **retention period** in AWS CloudWatch for metrics does involve **aggregation** of data as it ages, rather than just deleting it after a certain time.

Here’s a more detailed explanation of how **data aggregation** works in CloudWatch:

### Aggregation of Metrics as They Age

For **metrics with finer granularity** (such as **1-minute granularity**), CloudWatch does **not immediately delete** data as it becomes older. Instead, it **aggregates** the data over time, meaning it **summarizes** the data into **larger time intervals** (e.g., from 1-minute intervals to 5-minute or 1-hour intervals), which reduces the **granularity** of the data.

- **1-minute granularity** data is stored for **15 days**.
- After that, the data is **aggregated** and stored at **5-minute granularity** for **63 days**.
- After further aging, the data is **aggregated** again and stored at **1-hour granularity** for **455 days**.

### Example:

- If you have metrics with **1-minute granularity**, the data is stored at that high resolution for the first **15 days**. After that, CloudWatch will **aggregate** the data into 5-minute intervals.

  For instance, instead of storing a metric for every minute, it will **average** or **sum** the data for every 5-minute period. This allows for less storage usage but still provides meaningful insights.

- After the data reaches **63 days**, it will be **further aggregated** into 1-hour intervals, reducing the resolution even more.

### What Happens to the Data:

- **1-minute data** is **aggregated** into **5-minute** data after 15 days.
- **5-minute data** is **aggregated** into **1-hour** data after 63 days.
- **1-hour data** is kept for up to **455 days**.

### So, to clarify:

- **Data is not deleted** immediately after it hits the retention period. Instead, it is **aggregated** (summarized) over time and stored at lower granularities (e.g., from 1 minute → 5 minutes → 1 hour).
- **Detailed 1-minute data** will be available for **15 days**, after which it is aggregated into a lower-resolution format and stored for a longer period.

This aggregation process ensures that you can still track long-term trends, even though the **granularity** becomes coarser as the data ages.
