- **📈Scalability:** Automatically scales to handle any volume of messages without manual intervention.

- **💡Two Queue Types:**
  - **Standard Queues:** Offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery.
  - **FIFO Queues:** Ensure exactly-once processing and preserve the exact order of messages.

### 📊 **Use Cases for SQS:**

- **📦 Decoupling Microservices:** Allow independent scaling and maintenance of services.

- **🛠️ Task Queuing:** Manage background tasks like image processing, data analysis, or email sending.

- **📈 Load Leveling:** Smooth out spikes in traffic by queuing incoming requests.
