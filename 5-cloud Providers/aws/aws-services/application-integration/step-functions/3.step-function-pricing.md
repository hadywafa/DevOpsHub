# AWS Step Functions

AWS Step Functions pricing is based on the type of workflow you use: Standard Workflows or Express Workflows.

## Standard Workflows

- **State Transitions**: You are charged for each state transition in your workflow. A state transition occurs each time a step in your workflow is executed.
- **Free Tier**: The free tier includes 4,000 state transitions per month.
- **Pricing**: After the free tier, you are charged \$0.025 per 1,000 state transitions.

## Express Workflows

- **Requests**: You are charged based on the number of requests for your workflow.
- **Duration**: You are also charged for the duration of your workflow execution, rounded up to the nearest 100ms.
- **Memory**: Charges are based on the amount of memory used in the execution of your workflow, billed in 64-MB chunks.

## Additional Charges

- **Other AWS Services**: If your workflow uses other AWS services (e.g., AWS Lambda), you will be billed for those services separately.
