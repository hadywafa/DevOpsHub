when i create sqs standard and make visibility time 4 seconds and when i pull for 16 time it gives me received count 4 .? why ?

### Solution

When you set the **visibility timeout** to **4 seconds** in an **Amazon SQS Standard queue**, it means that once a message is received, it becomes invisible to other consumers for **4 seconds**. If the message isn't deleted within those 4 seconds, it becomes visible again and can be received by another consumer.

If you pull messages **16 times**, you'll receive up to **4 messages** because the visibility timeout ensures that each message is only invisible for 4 seconds. After 4 seconds, if the message hasn't been deleted, it reappears in the queue and can be received again.

Does that help clarify things?
