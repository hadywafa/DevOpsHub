## üåÄ **Message Lifecycle**

Understanding the message lifecycle in Amazon SQS is crucial for effectively utilizing its features to build robust applications. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how messages flow from producers to consumers, including success and failure scenarios.

### 1. **Message Production**

- **Producer Sends Message:**

  - Applications or services (like EC2 instances or Lambda functions) send messages to an SQS queue.
  - **Batch Sending:** Up to **10 messages** can be sent in a single batch, with a total size not exceeding **256KB**. This helps optimize throughput and reduce costs by minimizing the number of API requests.

  **Example:** An application sends order details to an SQS queue for processing by backend services.

- **Delay Queue (Optional):**

  - **Definition:** A feature that postpones the delivery of new messages to the queue.
  - **Configuration:** Set a delay time (0 seconds to 15 minutes) when sending a message.
  - **Purpose:** Schedule tasks for future processing or implement retry logic without additional application code.

  **Example:** Delaying a message for user account activation by 10 minutes after registration.

### 2. **Message Storage**

- **Retention Period:**

  - **Definition:** The duration a message remains in the queue before it is automatically deleted if not processed.
  - **Range:** 1 minute to 14 days (default is 4 days).
  - **Purpose:** Ensures messages are available for processing within a specified timeframe.

  **Example:** Setting a retention period of 7 days for order processing messages to allow ample time for handling delayed orders.

### 3. **Message Retrieval and Processing**

- **Consumer Polls Queue:**

  - Consumers (like EC2 instances or Lambda functions) poll the queue to retrieve messages for processing.
  - **Polling Types:**
    - **Short Polling (Default):** Returns immediately, even if the queue is empty. This can lead to higher costs due to the increased number of requests.
    - **Long Polling:** Waits up to **20 seconds** (configurable) for a message to appear before responding. This reduces the number of empty responses and lowers costs by minimizing unnecessary polling.

  **Example:** A Lambda function polls the SQS queue every few seconds to process incoming messages.

- **Visibility Timeout:**

  - **Definition:** The duration during which a retrieved message is hidden from other consumers.
  - **Range:** 0 seconds to 12 hours (default is 30 seconds).
  - **Purpose:** Prevents multiple consumers from processing the same message simultaneously.

  **Flow:**

  1. **Retrieve Message:** Consumer fetches a message from the queue.
  2. **Lock Message:** The message becomes invisible to other consumers for the duration of the Visibility Timeout.
  3. **Process Message:** Consumer processes the message.
  4. **Delete Message:** Upon successful processing, the consumer deletes the message from the queue.
  5. **Failed Processing:** If the consumer fails to delete the message within the Visibility Timeout, the message becomes visible again for another attempt.

  **Example:** A message to process an image upload has a Visibility Timeout of 60 seconds. If processing completes within this time, the message is deleted. If not, it becomes visible again for another attempt.

### 4. **Message Deletion or Redelivery**

- **Successful Processing:**

  - After processing, the consumer deletes the message, ensuring it won't be processed again.

- **Failed Processing:**

  - If processing fails or exceeds the Visibility Timeout, the message becomes visible again for another consumer to process.
  - **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ):**

    - **Purpose:** Capture messages that fail processing multiple times, aiding in troubleshooting and error handling.
    - **Configuration:** Set up a DLQ to receive messages after a specified number of failed processing attempts.

    **Example:** A message fails to process three times and is moved to a DLQ for manual review.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Queue Types**

Amazon SQS offers two primary types of queues to cater to different application needs: **Standard Queues** and **FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Queues**.

### üí• 1. **Standard SQS Queue**

- **Throughput:** Unlimited transactions per second (TPS).
- **Delivery:** At least once delivery; duplicates are possible.
- **Ordering:** Best-effort ordering; messages might not be received in the exact order they were sent.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for high-throughput, distributed systems where occasional duplicates are acceptable.

  **Example:** Processing user registrations where duplicate processing is not critical.

### üî¢ 2. **FIFO SQS Queue**

<div align="center" style="padding:0 20px">
  <img src="images/sqs-fifo.gif" alt="fifo" />
</div>

- **Throughput:**
  - **Standard Mode:** 300 TPS per API action.
  - **With Batching:** Up to 3,000 TPS per API action.
- **Delivery:** Exactly once processing; no duplicates.
- **Ordering:** Strictly preserves the order of messages.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for applications where the order of operations and exactly-once processing are critical, such as financial transactions.

  **Example:** Processing payment transactions where order and uniqueness are essential.

## ‚ùì **Polling Types**

SQS operates on a **poll-based** model, where consumers must poll the queue to retrieve messages. Understanding the polling types helps optimize cost and performance.

### 1. ‚ö° **Short Polling (Default)**

- **Behavior:** Returns immediately, even if the queue is empty.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="images/sqs-short-polling.png" style="border-radius:10px" alt="sqs-short-polling" />
</div>

- **Cost:** Higher due to the increased number of requests, as empty responses still count as requests.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for scenarios where immediate response is required, regardless of message availability.

  **Example:** An application needs to check for messages continuously without delay, even if there are no messages.

### 2. ‚åõ **Long Polling**

- **Behavior:** Waits up to **20 seconds** (configurable) for a message to appear in the queue before responding.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="images/sqs-long-polling.png" style="border-radius:10px" alt="sqs-long-polling" />
</div>

- **Cost:** Lower, as it reduces the number of empty responses and unnecessary polling.
- **Use Case:** Efficient for reducing costs and improving performance by minimizing unnecessary polling.

  **Example:** A worker service processes messages as they arrive, waiting for up to 20 seconds for new messages to reduce polling frequency.

**How to Implement Long Polling:**

- **Receive Message Wait Time:** Configure the `WaitTimeSeconds` parameter in your poll request.
- **Queue Configuration:** You can also set a default long polling duration for the queue itself to apply to all consumers.

## üïë **Retention Period, Visibility Timeout & Delay Queue**

These three features are integral to managing how messages are handled within the SQS queue, ensuring reliability and efficiency.

### 1. **Retention Period**

- **Definition:** The duration a message remains in the queue before it is automatically deleted if not processed.
- **Range:** 1 minute to 14 days (default is 4 days).
- **Purpose:** Ensures messages are available for processing within a specified timeframe.
- **Impact:** A longer retention period ensures messages remain available for longer, accommodating delayed processing or high traffic spikes.
- **Example:** Use a retention period of 14 days for backup tasks that might require extended processing time.

### 2. **Visibility Timeout**

- **Definition:** The duration of time a message is locked for read by other consumers after it has been read by a consumer to process it.
- **Range:** 0 seconds to 12 hours (default is 30 seconds).
- **Purpose:** Prevents multiple consumers from processing the same message simultaneously.
- **Impact:** Ensures that only one consumer can process a message at a time, reducing the risk of duplicate processing.
- **Example:** For tasks that take up to 2 minutes to process, set the Visibility Timeout to 3 minutes to allow for retries if processing fails.

### 3. **Delay Queue**

- **Definition:** Allows for delaying the delivery of new messages to the queue.
- **Range:** 0 seconds to 15 minutes (default is 0 seconds).
- **Purpose:** Schedules message processing for a future time, useful for delaying tasks or implementing retries.
- **Impact:** Enables you to postpone processing of messages without additional application logic.
- **Example:** Delay messages by 5 minutes to batch process updates or schedule notifications.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Auto Scaling the Consumers**

To efficiently process messages, consumers can scale based on specific CloudWatch metrics. This ensures that your application can handle varying loads without manual intervention.

### üìà **Key CloudWatch Metrics for Auto Scaling:**

1. **ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage:**

   - **Definition:** The approximate age of the oldest non-deleted message in the queue.
   - **Use Case:** Helps determine if messages are being processed in a timely manner. High values may indicate a backlog.

2. **NumberOfMessagesSent:**

   - **Definition:** The number of messages added to the queue.
   - **Use Case:** Tracks the influx of new messages, aiding in scaling decisions based on message volume.

3. **ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible:**
   - **Definition:** The number of messages available for retrieval from the queue.
   - **Use Case:** Indicates how many messages are ready to be processed, guiding the scaling of consumer instances.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Steps:**

1. **Set Up Auto Scaling Groups (for EC2 Consumers):**

   - **Configuration:** Define scaling policies based on the above CloudWatch metrics.
   - **Example:** Increase the number of EC2 instances when `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` exceeds a certain threshold.

2. **Configure Lambda Functions:**

   - **Automatic Scaling:** Lambda functions inherently scale based on the number of incoming messages, reducing the need for manual scaling configurations.
   - **Monitoring:** Use CloudWatch metrics to monitor and adjust concurrency settings if necessary.

3. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Continuously monitor the selected metrics to ensure optimal scaling and processing performance.
   - Adjust thresholds and scaling policies based on application requirements and observed patterns.

### üìä **Pricing Components:**

1. **Requests:**

   - **Standard Queues:** \$0.40 per million requests.
   - **FIFO Queues:** \$0.50 per million requests.

2. **Payload:**

   - **Standard Queues:** Each **64 KB chunk** of payload is considered **one request**.
   - **FIFO Queues:** Similar pricing applies with slight differences based on throughput and features.

3. **Data Transfer:**
   - **Outbound Data:** Charges apply for data transferred out of AWS regions.
   - **Inbound Data:** Typically free, but always refer to the [AWS SQS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/pricing/) for detailed information.

### üìå **Cost Considerations:**

- **Batch Operations:**

  - **Efficiency:** Sending or receiving messages in batches can optimize costs by reducing the number of API requests.
  - **Example:** Sending 10 messages in a single batch counts as 10 requests, same as sending them individually.

- **FIFO Queues:**

  - **Higher Cost:** Due to advanced features like exactly-once processing and strict ordering, FIFO queues are priced slightly higher than Standard queues.

- **Data Transfer:**
  - **Monitor Costs:** Especially if your application involves significant outbound traffic, keep an eye on data transfer costs.

### üí° **Example Calculation:**

- **Scenario:**

  - **Queue Type:** Standard
  - **Messages Sent:** 5 million per month
  - **Message Size:** 128 KB (counts as 2 requests per message)

- **Calculation:**

  - **Requests Cost:** 5M messages √ó 2 requests = 10M requests

    - 10M √ó $0.40 / 1M = **$4.00\*\*

  - **Total Monthly Cost:** **\$4.00**
