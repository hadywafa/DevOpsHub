## ‚úÖ When to Use AWS App Runner

- **Simplified Deployment:**
  - If you prefer quick deployment from source code or container images without configuring infrastructure.
- **Web and API Applications:**
  - For hosting web applications and RESTful APIs with minimal configuration.
- **No Container Expertise:**
  - Ideal for developers with no prior experience in container orchestration or AWS services.
- **Auto Scaling Focus:**
  - When your application needs to scale automatically based on traffic without manual setup.

## ‚úÖ When to Use ECS Fargate

- **Complex Workloads:**
  - If your application requires fine-grained control over tasks, services, and networking.
- **Orchestration Needs:**
  - When deploying multi-container applications with complex dependencies.
- **Custom Scaling Policies:**
  - For applications requiring specific scaling rules.

## ‚úÖ When to Use Elastic Beanstalk

- **Broad Application Support:**
  - Suitable for applications in a variety of platforms like Java, Python, PHP, and .NET.
- **Code-First Deployment:**
  - Ideal for developers who prefer to deploy directly from source code.
- **Infrastructure Flexibility:**
  - Allows more control over the underlying environment, such as instance types and load balancers.
- **Legacy Applications:**
  - Great for migrating existing applications without containerizing them.
