# üîç Amazon ECR Image Scanning: Comprehensive Guide

## üß† Overview

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) offers two primary image scanning options:

1. **Basic Scanning**: Detects vulnerabilities in the operating system packages of your container images.
2. **Enhanced Scanning**: Provides continuous and deeper scanning capabilities, including application dependencies, using Amazon Inspector.

## üõ°Ô∏è Basic Scanning

### ‚úÖ What It Is

Basic scanning in ECR analyzes your container images for known vulnerabilities in the operating system packages. It utilizes the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) database to identify issues.

### üîß How to Enable Basic Scanning

By default, basic scanning is enabled for all private registries. However, you can configure it further:

#### AWS Console

1. Navigate to the **ECR Console**.
2. Select **Private registry** from the navigation pane.
3. Click on **Settings**.
4. Under **Scanning configuration**, choose **Basic scanning**.
5. Optionally, set up scan-on-push filters for specific repositories.

#### AWS CLI

```bash
aws ecr put-registry-scanning-configuration \
  --scan-type BASIC \
  --rules '[{"repositoryFilters": [{"filter": "*", "filterType": "WILDCARD"}], "scanFrequency": "SCAN_ON_PUSH"}]' \
  --region your-region
```

Replace `your-region` with your desired AWS region.

### üìù Notes

- Basic scanning can be configured to scan images on push or manually.
- You can scan up to 100,000 images per 24 hours in a given registry.
- Scanning is limited to once per image every 24 hours.

## üöÄ Enhanced Scanning with Amazon Inspector

### ‚úÖ What It Is

Enhanced scanning provides continuous and deeper analysis of your container images, including application dependencies. It leverages Amazon Inspector to detect vulnerabilities beyond the operating system level.

### üîß How to Enable Enhanced Scanning

#### AWS Console

1. Navigate to the **ECR Console**.
2. Select **Private registry** from the navigation pane.
3. Click on **Settings**.
4. Under **Scanning configuration**, choose **Enhanced scanning**.
5. Configure scan filters as needed.

#### AWS CLI

```bash
aws ecr put-registry-scanning-configuration \
  --scan-type ENHANCED \
  --rules '[{"repositoryFilters": [{"filter": "*", "filterType": "WILDCARD"}], "scanFrequency": "CONTINUOUS_SCAN"}]' \
  --region your-region
```

Replace `your-region` with your desired AWS region.

### üìù Notes

- Enhanced scanning provides continuous monitoring of your images.
- It supports a broader range of operating systems and application packages.
- Amazon Inspector must be enabled in your account.

## üîç Retrieving Scan Findings

You can retrieve the results of your image scans to assess vulnerabilities.

### AWS Console

1. Navigate to the **ECR Console**.
2. Select your repository and image.
3. View the **Scan findings** tab for detailed results.

### AWS CLI

```bash
aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings \
  --repository-name your-repo-name \
  --image-id imageTag=your-image-tag \
  --region your-region
```

Replace `your-repo-name`, `your-image-tag`, and `your-region` with your specific details.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Scanning

If you have images that weren't scanned on push, you can initiate a manual scan.

### AWS CLI

```bash
aws ecr start-image-scan \
  --repository-name your-repo-name \
  --image-id imageTag=your-image-tag \
  --region your-region
```

Replace `your-repo-name`, `your-image-tag`, and `your-region` with your specific details.

---

## üß∞ Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **UnsupportedImageError**: Occurs when scanning an image built from an unsupported operating system or the `scratch` base image.
- **UNDEFINED Severity**: Indicates that the vulnerability's severity couldn't be determined from the CVE source.
- **SCAN_ELIGIBILITY_EXPIRED**: Happens when images are older than the scanning eligibility window. Re-push the image to make it eligible again.

For more detailed troubleshooting, refer to the [Amazon ECR Image Scanning Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning-troubleshooting.html).

## üìã Best Practices

- **Enable Enhanced Scanning**: For comprehensive vulnerability detection, especially in application dependencies.
- **Use Scan-on-Push**: To ensure immediate scanning of new images.
- **Implement Lifecycle Policies**: To remove untagged or old images, reducing storage costs and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor Scan Findings**: Regularly review scan results and address high or critical vulnerabilities promptly.
- **Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate scanning processes within your development workflows.
