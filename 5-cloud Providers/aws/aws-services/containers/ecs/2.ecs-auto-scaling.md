# üìà Auto Scaling in Amazon ECS: Instance and Task Scaling

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) offers **Auto Scaling** capabilities to dynamically adjust resources based on application demands. This ensures cost efficiency and high availability by scaling ECS instances or tasks when needed.

**ECS supports two types of Auto Scaling**:

1. **ECS Instance Auto Scaling**
2. **ECS Task Auto Scaling**.

## üñ•Ô∏è ECS Instance Auto Scaling

ECS Instance Auto Scaling focuses on scaling the underlying EC2 instances that host your ECS tasks. It uses **ECS Auto Scaling Groups capacity providers** to manage instance scaling actions.

### üîÑ How It Works

1. **Managed Scaling:**

   - Enables ECS to automatically scale in and out based on cluster utilization.
   - Uses the **CapacityProviderReservation** CloudWatch metric to track resource usage in the cluster and trigger scaling actions.
   - EC2 Auto Scaling handles adding or removing instances.

2. **Manual Scaling:**

   - Allows you to manually configure scaling policies by turning off managed scaling.

3. **Launch Types Supported:**

   - Both **EC2** and **Fargate** launch types.

### üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Steps

1. **Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG):**
   - Define the desired capacity, minimum, and maximum instances.
2. **Attach a Capacity Provider:**
   - Link the ASG to the ECS cluster as a capacity provider.
3. **Enable Managed Scaling (Optional):**
   - Set `Managed Scaling` to `Enabled` in the ECS console.
4. **Monitor Cluster Utilization:**
   - Use the **CapacityProviderReservation** metric to review scaling actions.

## üì¶ ECS Task Auto Scaling

ECS Task Auto Scaling adjusts the number of tasks running within your services to handle varying workload demands. This uses **Application Auto Scaling** to monitor CloudWatch metrics and scale tasks dynamically.

### üîÑ How It Works

1. **Scaling Policies:**

   - **Target Tracking:** Automatically adjusts the task count to maintain a specific metric value (e.g., CPU utilization).
   - **Step Scaling:** Adjusts task count in predefined steps when thresholds are crossed.
   - **Scheduled Scaling:** Scales tasks at specified times based on expected traffic.

2. **Supported Metrics:**

   - **Average CPU Utilization.**
   - **Average Memory Utilization.**
   - **ALB Request Count per Target (for services behind an ALB).**

3. **Launch Types Supported:**

   - Works with both **EC2** and **Fargate** tasks.

### üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Steps

1. **Enable Service Auto Scaling:**
   - In the ECS console, choose the service and enable Service Auto Scaling.
2. **Define Scaling Policies:**
   - Configure target tracking, step scaling, or scheduled scaling policies.
3. **Set CloudWatch Alarms:**
   - Define metrics like CPU or memory utilization to trigger scaling.
4. **Verify Scaling Actions:**
   - Monitor task scaling activity in the ECS console or CloudWatch.

## üîÑ Key Differences: ECS Instance Auto Scaling vs. Task Auto Scaling

| Feature                 | ECS Instance Auto Scaling                    | ECS Task Auto Scaling                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**             | Scales the underlying EC2 instances.         | Scales the number of running tasks.     |
| **Managed By**          | ECS Capacity Providers and EC2 Auto Scaling. | Application Auto Scaling.               |
| **Metric Used**         | CapacityProviderReservation.                 | CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, etc.). |
| **Scope**               | Cluster-wide.                                | Service-specific.                       |
| **Launch Type Support** | EC2 and Fargate.                             | EC2 and Fargate.                        |
