## 🚀 **What is AWS Transit Gateway?**

Think of **AWS Transit Gateway** as your network's central traffic hub, connecting multiple VPCs and external resources in a streamlined **hub-and-spoke architecture**.

### 🔑 **Key Features:**

- **Regional Resource**: Centralized connectivity within one AWS region.
- **High Availability**: Operates across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), ensuring reliability.
- **Multi-account Support**: Can be shared across AWS accounts via **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)**.

---

## 🛞 **How AWS Transit Gateway Works**

**Hub-and-Spoke Model:** Transit Gateway (hub) simplifies network architecture by connecting multiple resources (spokes).

### ✨ **Benefits:**

- **Network Management Simplification**
- **Scalability** (supports thousands of VPCs)
- **Centralized Connectivity & Routing**

---

## 🌎 **VPC Access Across Regions**

Transit Gateway supports **inter-region peering**, enabling global connectivity across multiple AWS regions.

</div>

### 🛠️ **Setup Requirements:**

- Establish Transit Gateways in each region.
- Configure inter-region peering between them.

---

## ⚙️ **How to Set Up AWS Transit Gateway**

1. **Create Transit Gateway** in AWS Console.
2. **Establish Attachments**:
   - **VPCs**
   - **VPN Connections** (on-premises connectivity)
   - **Direct Connect Gateways** (dedicated network)
   - **Transit Gateway Connect Attachments** (third-party appliances via GRE tunnel)

---

## 🔩 **Transit Gateway Connect**

Integrates third-party virtual appliances (e.g., SD-WAN) using:

- **GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)** for tunneling
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** for dynamic routing

</div>

---

## 🖧 **Supported Protocols**

- **IPv4 and IPv6**
- **BGP** for dynamic route propagation

---

## 💵 **Transit Gateway Costs**

- **Hourly charges** for gateway and attachments
- **Data processing charges** based on traffic volume

**Cost-saving Tip:** Use attachments within the same AZ to minimize charges.

## 🏆 **Comparing AWS Transit Gateway to VPC Peering**

| **Feature**                      | **AWS Transit Gateway**                   | **VPC Peering**                    |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Scalability 📈**               | Easily scalable for large infrastructures | Difficult with increasing VPCs     |
| **Transitive Routing 🔄**        | Supported                                 | Not Supported                      |
| **Cross-Region Connectivity 🌍** | Supported                                 | Supported                          |
| **Connectivity Complexity ⚙️**   | Simplified (hub-and-spoke)                | Complex (multiple direct peerings) |
| **Management 🛠️**                | Fully AWS-managed                         | Customer-managed                   |
