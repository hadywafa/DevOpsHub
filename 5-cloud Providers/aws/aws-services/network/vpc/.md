# 🌐 AWS VPC Basics

Understanding AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is crucial for managing your cloud network infrastructure securely and efficiently. Let's break it down in a structured, engaging, and easy-to-follow way!

---

## 🛡️ VPC Rules

- Every AWS region gets a **default VPC** automatically upon AWS account creation.
- A VPC is confined to a **single AWS region**—you can't stretch it across regions.
- A VPC can span all **Availability Zones (AZs)** within its region and include multiple subnets.

---

## 🔩 Key VPC Components

### 1️⃣ **CIDR Block**

- A primary CIDR block is set during creation and **cannot be modified later**.
- You can add up to 4 additional secondary CIDR blocks to extend your IP address space (with limitations).

### 2️⃣ **Subnets**

</div>

- Multiple subnets per VPC are possible.
- Each subnet resides within one AZ—subnets **cannot span AZs**.
- Subnets within a VPC **must not overlap**.

### 3️⃣ **Implied Router**

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/aws-implied-router.png" alt="AWS Implied Router" style="border-radius:10px;">
</div>

- AWS manages this hidden router.
- Handles routing between VPC subnets and the external world.
- Automatic routing between VPC subnets is guaranteed.

### 4️⃣ **Route Tables**

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/aws-route-table.png" alt="AWS Route Tables" style="border-radius:10px;">
</div>

- Each VPC includes a default "main" route table.
- A subnet can associate with one route table at a time, but one route table can serve multiple subnets.
- Custom route tables can be created as needed.

### 5️⃣ **Internet Gateway (IGW)**

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/aws-igw.png" alt="AWS Internet Gateway" style="border-radius:10px;">
</div>

- Highly available and horizontally scalable.
- Managed entirely by AWS.
- **Only one IGW** per VPC, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.

### 6️⃣ **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)**

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/aws-vgw.png" alt="AWS Virtual Private Gateway" style="border-radius:10px;">
</div>

- Used for **Hybrid Cloud Connectivity**.
- Managed fully by AWS.
- **Only one VGW** per VPC.

### 7️⃣ **Security Groups (SG)**

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/nsg-0.png" alt="Security Group Example 1" style="border-radius:10px;">
  <img src="images/nsg-1.png" alt="Security Group Example 2" style="border-radius:10px;">
  <img src="images/nsg-2.png" alt="Security Group Example 3" style="border-radius:10px;">
  <img src="images/nsg-3.png" alt="Security Group Example 4" style="border-radius:10px;">
</div>

- Acts as a virtual firewall at the instance (ENI) level.
- **Stateful** and **whitelist-based** (no deny rules).
- Evaluates all rules; changes apply instantly.
- Supports multiple SGs per EC2 instance ENI.

### 8️⃣ **Network ACLs (NACLs)**

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/nacl-0.png" alt="AWS Network ACL" style="border-radius:10px;">
</div>

- Stateless firewall at the subnet level.
- Permits and denies rules; evaluated by sequence number.
- Default explicit deny at the end.

## 🌉 Hybrid Cloud Connectivity

<div align="center">

</div>

Two primary connectivity methods:

- **VPN:** Internet-based, secure, fast setup, cost-effective, but sometimes unreliable.
- **Direct Connect (DX):** Fiber cable, reliable, low latency, high bandwidth, long setup time.

> You can combine both for improved reliability and security.

## 🔐 Security Groups vs. Network ACLs

| Feature         | Security Groups (SG)                 | Network ACLs (NACLs)            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Operation Level | Instance (ENI) level                 | Subnet level                    |
| Supported Rules | Allow rules only                     | Allow and deny rules            |
| Statefulness    | Stateful                             | Stateless                       |
| Rule Evaluation | All rules evaluated                  | Evaluated in sequence order     |
| Filtering Scope | Applies only to associated instances | Applies to all subnet instances |

## ❓ Additional Concepts

### 📌 AWS Identity Center

AWS service for managing workforce access and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.

### 📋 Credential Report

Lists all IAM users and credential statuses (stored for up to 4 hours).

### 📶 IPAM (IP Address Manager)

AWS service for managing IP addresses efficiently across AWS environments.

### 🌍 NAT (Network Address Translation)

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/aws-nat.png" alt="AWS NAT" style="border-radius:10px;">
</div>

Allows instances in private subnets to connect to the internet without being publicly accessible.

### 🔀 Public vs. Private Subnets

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/aws-pub-private-subnets.png" alt="Public vs Private Subnets" style="border-radius:10px;">
</div>

- **Public:** Connected directly to IGW for internet access.
- **Private:** No direct IGW connectivity, requires NAT for internet access.

### 🔢 ASN (Autonomous System Number)

Unique ID for routing internet traffic between networks. Used in AWS for BGP routing (Direct Connect & VPC).
