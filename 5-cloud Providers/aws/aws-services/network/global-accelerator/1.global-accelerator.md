# üåç **AWS Global Accelerator: Enhancing Application Availability and Performance**

AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service designed to optimize the availability and performance of your applications by intelligently routing user traffic across multiple AWS regions and endpoints. This guide provides an in-depth look at AWS Global Accelerator, its components, benefits, use cases, and a comparison with Amazon CloudFront to help you make informed decisions for your infrastructure needs.

## üßê **What is AWS Global Accelerator?**

**AWS Global Accelerator** is a networking service that improves the availability and performance of your applications by directing user traffic through the AWS global network infrastructure. It provides two static Anycast IP addresses that serve as fixed entry points to your application endpoints (such as EC2 instances, Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Elastic IPs) across multiple AWS regions.

### üìà **Key Features:**

- **Static Anycast IPs:** Provides fixed entry points to your applications, simplifying DNS management.
- **Intelligent Traffic Routing:** Routes traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint based on health, geography, and policies.
- **Health Checks:** Continuously monitors the health of your application endpoints and reroutes traffic in case of failures.
- **Client IP Preservation:** Maintains the client‚Äôs IP address for compliance and security purposes.
- **Support for UDP and TCP:** Enables acceleration for both UDP and TCP-based applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Components**

### üåê **Anycast IP Addresses**

**Anycast IP** addresses are fundamental to how AWS Global Accelerator operates. They are static, internet-routable IP addresses that are advertised from multiple AWS edge locations worldwide.

#### üìä **How Anycast IPs Work:**

</div>

1. **Multiple Advertisements:** The same Anycast IP address is advertised from multiple AWS edge locations.
2. **Nearest Routing:** User traffic is automatically routed to the nearest edge location based on network topology and routing policies.
3. **High Availability:** If one edge location becomes unavailable, traffic is rerouted to the next nearest location without client intervention.

#### üåç **Anycast IPs in AWS:**

</div>

- **Allocation:** Each Global Accelerator instance is assigned two static Anycast IPs for IPv4 or four for dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6).
- **BYOIP Option:** Customers can bring their own IP addresses (BYOIP) to use with Global Accelerator.
- **Persistence:** The static Anycast IPs remain associated with the accelerator even when it is disabled, ensuring consistency.

## üîÑ **How AWS Global Accelerator Works**

AWS Global Accelerator enhances application performance and availability through intelligent traffic management:

1. **User Request:** A user initiates a request to your application using one of the Global Accelerator's static Anycast IPs.
2. **Routing via AWS Edge Locations:** The request is routed to the nearest AWS edge location using the AWS global network.
3. **Traffic Distribution:** Global Accelerator intelligently directs the traffic to the optimal endpoint based on policies, health checks, and performance metrics.
4. **Response Delivery:** The response travels back to the user via the optimized AWS network, ensuring low latency and high throughput.
