# **Using CloudFront To Serve Private Content** üîê

CloudFront offers a secure way to distribute sensitive or paid content, restricting access to only authorized users. This can be achieved by using **Signed URLs** and **Signed Cookies**.

## **Overview of Private Content Delivery** üåê

When we need to serve private or restricted content via CloudFront, we can ensure that only authorized users or applications can access the content. This is done by using **Signed URLs** and **Signed Cookies**.

- **CloudFront** allows us to restrict access to cached content at edge locations.
- The content can be signed by the application using a **private key** from a **key pair**. CloudFront then validates the signature using the corresponding **public key**.

### **Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Generate the Signed URL or Cookie**:
   - The application creates a signed URL or cookie using a private key.
2. **Validate with CloudFront**:
   - CloudFront validates the signature using the corresponding **public key**.
3. **Secure the Content**:
   - Only users with valid signed URLs or cookies can access the restricted content.

## **Signed URLs & Signed Cookies ‚Äì Which One To Use?** üç™üîë

When deciding whether to use **Signed URLs** or **Signed Cookies**, the choice depends on the specific use case.

### **1. Signed URLs** üîó

- **Use Case**: When the application does not support cookies or you want to restrict access to **individual files** (e.g., a single video file, a specific image).
- **Control**: You can specify the **expiry time**, **validity period**, and **source IP address** that can access the content.

  **Example**: A signed URL for a video file that expires in 1 hour, only accessible from a specific IP address range.

### **2. Signed Cookies** üç™

- **Use Case**: When you need to **provide access to multiple restricted files** or want to avoid changing URLs that are already in use.
- **Control**: Signed cookies allow you to specify permissions for multiple files using a single cookie.

  **Example**: If you are providing access to a paid video streaming service, signed cookies can be used to grant access to multiple video files without modifying the URLs.

## **Key Benefits of Using Signed URLs and Cookies** ‚úÖ

- **Granular Control**: Define specific permissions for who can access your content and when.
- **Enhanced Security**: Only authorized users with valid signed URLs or cookies can access the restricted content.
- **Easy Integration**: CloudFront integrates with **AWS IAM** to generate the signed keys, making it easy to manage access securely.

By using **Signed URLs** and **Signed Cookies**, you can effectively control access to your private content, ensuring that only authorized users are able to retrieve it from CloudFront edge locations. Whether you‚Äôre distributing individual files or a collection of content, CloudFront provides a secure and scalable solution for delivering private content.
