# 🛡️ Amazon CloudFront Field-Level Encryption

> _Secure sensitive form fields with end-to-end protection using asymmetric encryption._

## 🔐 What Is Field-Level Encryption?

**Field-Level Encryption** allows you to **encrypt specific fields** (like credit card numbers, SSNs, etc.) in **HTTP POST requests** — from the **user’s browser all the way to your backend application**.

This ensures that **sensitive data stays encrypted** during transit through all layers, including **CloudFront**, **edge locations**, and **origin servers**.

## 🧬 Key Features

| Feature                          | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔑 **End-to-End Encryption**     | Sensitive fields are encrypted from user → CloudFront → origin → application |
| 🔐 **Asymmetric Encryption**     | Uses **public-private key pair** (RSA)                                       |
| 📥 **Up to 10 Fields**           | You choose which HTTP POST fields to encrypt                                 |
| 🔒 **Public Key on CloudFront**  | Used to encrypt the fields                                                   |
| 🧠 **Private Key at Origin App** | Used to decrypt the fields                                                   |

## 🔁 How It Works

<div style="text-align: center;">

```mermaid

    participant UserBrowser
    participant CloudFront
    participant OriginApp

    UserBrowser->>CloudFront: HTTPS POST with encrypted fields
    CloudFront->>OriginApp: Forwards encrypted POST (HTTPS)
    OriginApp->>OriginApp: Decrypts using private key
```

## 🛠️ Setup Overview

1. **Generate an RSA key pair** (2048-bit recommended).
2. **Upload the public key** to CloudFront.
3. Create a **Field-Level Encryption Configuration**:
   - Define which POST fields to encrypt (max 10).
   - Attach the public key.
4. Configure your **CloudFront Distribution** to use this encryption config.
5. Your **application stack must have the private key** to decrypt those fields.
