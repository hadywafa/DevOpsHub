</div>

---

**Simple Routing** is the most straightforward routing policy in Route 53, ideal for directing traffic to a single resource.

> ⚠️ R53 Return all mapped ips for your record and your browser randomly(may be round-roben) choose one of them (not latency or weighted)

### 📌 **Key Features:**

- **Single Resource Target**: Best suited when you have one resource (e.g., a single web server) serving your content.
- **No Health Checks**: Does not support health checks, meaning Route 53 won't monitor the health of your resource.
- **Use Case Limitation**: Not recommended for multiple resources as it doesn't provide redundancy or failover capabilities.

### 🚫 **Limitations:**

- **No Failover Support**: If the single resource becomes unavailable, Route 53 cannot automatically redirect traffic to another resource.
- **No Load Balancing**: Cannot distribute traffic across multiple resources.

## 🛡️ **2. Failover Routing Policy (Active/Passive Failover)**

</div>

---

**Failover Routing** is designed to improve the availability of your application by routing traffic to a primary resource and failing over to a secondary resource if the primary becomes unhealthy.

### 📌 **Key Features:**

- **Active/Passive Setup**: Directs traffic to a primary (active) resource under normal conditions and to a secondary (passive) resource when the primary fails.
- **Supports Health Checks**: Monitors the health of the primary resource and automatically redirects traffic if it becomes unhealthy.
- **Short TTL Recommendation**: Set TTL to 60 seconds or less to ensure quick failover.

### 🔧 **Configuration Steps:**

1. **Primary and Secondary Records**: Create two DNS records—one for the primary resource and one for the secondary.
2. **Associate Health Checks**: Attach health checks to the primary record to monitor its status.
3. **Failover Behavior**: Route 53 automatically switches to the secondary record if the primary fails.

### ⚠️ **Considerations:**

- **Client Cache TTL**: Unable to influence client-side caching TTL, which might affect how quickly clients see the failover.

### 🛠️ **Use Cases:**

- Ensuring high availability by maintaining a backup resource.
- Disaster recovery setups where secondary resources take over during outages.

## ⚡ **3. Latency Routing Policy (Active/Active)**
