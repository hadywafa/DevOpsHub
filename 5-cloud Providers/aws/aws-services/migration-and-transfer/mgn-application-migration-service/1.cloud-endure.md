# ☁️💡 **CloudEndure Migration (Now AWS MGN): Migrate with Confidence**

> _“Move to the cloud with minimal downtime, zero headaches, and total confidence.”_

**CloudEndure Migration** was AWS’s robust, agent-based service for **automating large-scale cloud migrations** with minimal disruption. It’s now rebranded and fully integrated into AWS as the **AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)** — providing the same great functionality, but with tighter AWS console integration and native support.

---

## 🧠 **What Was CloudEndure Migration?**

**CloudEndure Migration** helped organizations **lift and shift** workloads to AWS by continuously replicating servers in real time, then allowing a **cutover** to the cloud with only a few minutes of downtime.

It supported **Windows/Linux**, multiple **cloud providers**, and **on-prem environments**, with a focus on **minimal disruption** and **automated cutovers**.

### Breakdown

1. ✅ **Agent Installed** on source machines
2. 🔄 **Replication begins** in real-time to AWS (low-cost staging area)
3. 🧪 **Test launch** anytime without disruption
4. 🚀 **Cutover**: EC2 instance goes live in minutes
