## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Setup and Configuration:**

   - Deploy the Application Discovery Service using either **agent-based** or **agentless** methods.
   - For agent-based discovery, install lightweight agents on your servers to collect in-depth data.
   - For agentless discovery, deploy a virtual machine (VM) on your on-premises network to passively gather server metadata.

2. **Data Collection:**

   - The service collects configuration, usage, and performance data from servers.
   - It maps dependencies, identifies network traffic patterns, and records running processes.

3. **Data Analysis:**

   - The collected data is analyzed to provide insights into server performance and interdependencies.
   - Use these insights to determine optimal migration strategies and identify potential challenges.

4. **Integration with AWS Migration Hub:**

   - The data is integrated into **AWS Migration Hub** to centralize migration planning and execution.
   - You can track migration progress and manage tasks from a single dashboard.

5. **Export and Reporting:**
   - Export the collected data as **CSV files** for detailed analysis.
   - Use these reports to estimate AWS costs, plan server grouping, and document the migration process.
