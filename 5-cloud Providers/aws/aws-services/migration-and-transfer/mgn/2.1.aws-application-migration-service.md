# üõ†Ô∏è AWS MGN: The Re-host Migration Service

AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) is a **rehost (lift-and-shift)** migration service designed to make application migration to AWS simpler, faster, and cost-efficient. It leverages **CloudEndure** technology to enable reliable and automated migrations with minimal downtime.

## üåü Key Features of AWS MGN

### üîÑ Highly Automated Migration

- Simplifies the migration process by automating the conversion and launch of source servers into AWS.
- Ensures minimal manual intervention, making migrations faster and easier.

### üíæ Comprehensive Data Replication

- **What It Replicates:**
  - Operating systems.
  - System state configurations.
  - Applications and associated data.
- Replicates source servers to a low-cost **staging area** within the customer‚Äôs AWS account.

### üì¶ Cost Efficiency

- Uses affordable storage and minimal compute resources in the staging area to reduce costs during replication.
- Provisions Amazon EC2 instances and EBS volumes **only upon migration or disaster recovery activation**.

### üîß Versatility

- Supports migration from on-premises infrastructure, VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, and cloud-based environments.
- Enables **disaster recovery** with low RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective).

## üï∞Ô∏è History of AWS MGN

AWS MGN was introduced as the successor to AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS) and was built on the technology developed by **CloudEndure**, a company acquired by AWS. It became a key service for automated lift-and-shift migrations. However, as AWS evolved its disaster recovery services, **Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS)** became the recommended solution for most use cases.

## üîÑ Why AWS Recommends DRS Over MGN

While AWS MGN remains available, AWS recommends **Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS)** for most disaster recovery and migration scenarios due to its advanced capabilities. However, there are specific situations where MGN is preferred.

### **AWS Recommends DRS For:**

- Continuous replication to ensure data is always up-to-date.
- Cost-effective disaster recovery with low storage and compute costs in the staging area.
- Comprehensive features like point-in-time recovery and cross-region failover.

### **AWS Recommends MGN Only For:**

- **Replication to AWS GovCloud (US) or China Regions**: These regions are not currently supported by AWS DRS.
- **Operating Systems Not Supported by DRS**: MGN supports additional operating systems.
- **Replication into AWS Outposts**: For on-premises AWS environments, MGN is the recommended service.

## üéØ Use Cases of AWS MGN

1. **Lift-and-Shift Migrations**

   - Quickly migrate applications to AWS without refactoring or modifying code.

2. **Disaster Recovery (Selective)**

   - Use MGN for disaster recovery where DRS is unavailable due to regional or operating system limitations.

3. **Outposts Integration**
   - Migrate workloads into AWS Outposts environments for on-premises cloud solutions.

## ‚úÖ Summary: MGN vs. DRS

| **Feature**                      | **AWS MGN**                                  | **AWS DRS**                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Use**                  | Lift-and-shift migration                     | Disaster recovery and some migration scenarios |
| **Data Replication**             | To a staging area with eventual EC2 launch   | Continuous replication with low-cost staging   |
| **Disaster Recovery Capability** | Limited (low RPO/RTO only in specific cases) | Advanced, with point-in-time recovery          |
| **Supported Regions**            | Includes GovCloud and China Regions          | Excludes GovCloud and China Regions            |
| **Outposts Support**             | Supported                                    | Not supported                                  |

AWS MGN is a powerful tool for lift-and-shift migrations and specific disaster recovery scenarios. However, AWS **Elastic Disaster Recovery** is the preferred solution for most modern use cases due to its comprehensive features and cost efficiency. Businesses should evaluate their requirements to choose the right service for their needs.
