# **AWS Disaster Recovery (DRS) vs. AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)**

## **1. Overview**

**AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS)**:

- **Purpose**: Primarily designed for disaster recovery to help quickly recover applications and minimize downtime in unexpected events.
- **Native Service**: Developed by AWS with robust disaster recovery capabilities.
- **Recommendation**: Preferred for simple lift-and-shift migrations due to its simplicity and reliability.

**AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)**:

- **Purpose**: Focuses on automating lift-and-shift migrations of applications to AWS.
- **Evolved from CloudEndure**: Originally CloudEndure Migration, acquired and integrated by AWS.
- **Special Use Cases**: Recommended for specific scenarios where DRS may not be suitable.

## **3. Detailed Breakdown**

**Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS)**:

- **Robust Recovery**: Designed to provide rapid recovery of applications in disaster scenarios.
- **Minimal Downtime**: Ensures applications experience minimal downtime during recovery.
- **Ease of Use**: Recommended for simple migrations due to its straightforward approach.
- **Native Integration**: Fully integrated into the AWS ecosystem with strong support and resources.

**Application Migration Service (MGN)**:

- **Automated Migrations**: Highly automated lift-and-shift migrations, minimizing manual effort.
- **Evolved from CloudEndure**: Enhanced and integrated into AWS after the acquisition of CloudEndure in 2019.
- **Specific Capabilities**: Recommended for specialized use cases such as:
  - Replication to AWS GovCloud (US) or China Region.
  - Support for additional operating systems not yet supported by DRS.
  - Replication and recovery into AWS Outposts.

## **5. Example Scenario**

**Scenario**: A company needs to migrate its critical applications from an on-premises data center to AWS while ensuring minimal downtime and robust disaster recovery capabilities.

1. **Evaluation**:

   - **DRS**: Excellent for simple migration with strong disaster recovery.
   - **MGN**: Necessary if specific OS or region support is required.

2. **Implementation**:
   - **DRS**: Uses real-time replication to AWS with minimal downtime during cutover.
   - **MGN**: Automates the migration process with added capabilities for specialized use cases.
