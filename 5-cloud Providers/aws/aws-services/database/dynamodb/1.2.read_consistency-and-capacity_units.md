# üîç Amazon DynamoDB Read Consistency and Capacity Units

## üìö Data Consistency Model

When you read data from a database, it's important to know how up-to-date the data is. In Amazon DynamoDB, there are two types of read consistency:

1. **Eventual Consistency Reads:**

   - **What It Means:** The data you read might not be the latest.
   - **Benefit:** Provides the best-read performance (faster reads).

2. **Strong Consistency Reads:**
   - **What It Means:** The data you read is guaranteed to be the latest.
   - **Benefit:** Ensures you always get the most recent data.

> **Note:** DynamoDB supports both eventual consistency (default) and strong consistency. You can choose which one to use based on your needs.

## üßÆ Capacity Units in Amazon DynamoDB

**Capacity units** are how Amazon DynamoDB measures how much read and write activity your table is handling. Think of them as tokens that you spend to read and write data.

### üìñ Read Capacity Units (RCUs)

- **What are RCUs?**
  - RCUs are used to measure how much reading you are doing from your DynamoDB table.
- **How They Work:**
  - Every time you read data from the table, you use RCUs.
- **Measurement:**
  - **Strongly Consistent Read:**
    - 1 RCU = 1 read per second for an item up to 4KB in size.
    - Example: Reading one 4KB item once per second uses 1 RCU.
  - **Eventually Consistent Read:**
    - 1 RCU = 2 reads per second for an item up to 4KB in size.
    - Example: Reading one 4KB item twice per second uses 1 RCU.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Write Capacity Units (WCUs)

- **What are WCUs?**
  - WCUs are used to measure how much writing you are doing to your DynamoDB table.
- **How They Work:**
  - Every time you write data to the table, you use WCUs.
- **Measurement:**
  - **Write:**
    - 1 WCU = 1 write per second for an item up to 1KB in size.
    - Example: Writing one 1KB item once per second uses 1 WCU.

### üöÄ Examples

- **Example 1: Reading Data**

  - Suppose you have a table where each item is 4KB in size.
  - If you perform 10 strongly consistent reads per second:
    - You need 10 RCUs (because each 4KB read uses 1 RCU).

- **Example 2: Writing Data**
  - Suppose you have a table where each item is 2KB in size.
  - If you perform 5 writes per second:
    - Each write needs 2 WCUs (since each write is 2KB, which is twice the size of 1KB).
    - Total WCUs needed = 5 writes \* 2 WCUs per write = 10 WCUs.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Throttling

- **What is Throttling?**
  - If the number of reads or writes exceeds the allocated RCUs or WCUs, DynamoDB will throttle (slow down) your requests.
- **Why Throttling Happens:**
  - To ensure your table doesn't get overloaded and to maintain consistent performance.
