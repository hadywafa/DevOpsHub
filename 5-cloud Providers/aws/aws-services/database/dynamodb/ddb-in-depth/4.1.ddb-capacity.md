# 💰 Capacity Fundamentals in DynamoDB

## How Do Users Get Charged?

DynamoDB follows a **pay-per-use** pricing model, meaning you only pay for the resources and features you consume. The cost is primarily based on:

1️⃣ **Storage** – The amount of data stored in the table.  
2️⃣ **Read & Write Requests** – The number of read and write operations performed.

> 📌 **Pay-per-use** means customers pay based on actual usage rather than pre-purchasing resources. The more you use, the more you pay, and vice versa.

## Elastic Storage Scaling

Unlike traditional databases where users must estimate and provision storage in advance, DynamoDB automatically **scales storage dynamically**.

- 🚀 **Auto-scaling in 10 GB chunks** – New partitions are added as needed.
- 🏗️ No upfront provisioning required – Storage grows as data increases.
- ☁️ Works seamlessly compared to **on-premises** or **cloud databases** that require manual capacity planning.
