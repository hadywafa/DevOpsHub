# 🚀 **DynamoDB Streams & Pulling Mechanism: How It Works & Best Practices**

## 🏗 **How DynamoDB Streams Works Internally**

### 1️⃣ **Shards & Partition Mapping**

- **Each DynamoDB partition has a corresponding shard** in the stream.
- When an item is modified, the event is **recorded in the correct shard**.
- A **shard only contains records for its assigned partition**.

🔹 **Example:**

| **DynamoDB Partition** | **Stream Shard** |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Partition 1            | Shard 1          |
| Partition 2            | Shard 2          |
| Partition 3            | Shard 3          |

📌 **If Partition 2 is modified, the event appears in Shard 2.**

### 2️⃣ **Push vs. Pull Mechanism**

| **Mechanism** | **Description**                                                          | **Used By**               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Push**      | Event is **automatically delivered** to the consumer **without polling** | AWS SNS, SQS, EventBridge |
| **Pull**      | Consumer must **poll for new events** in a loop                          | DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis |

📌 **DynamoDB Streams uses a PULL mechanism**—consumers must fetch new records by **polling** the stream.

---

### 3️⃣ **How AWS Lambda Handles Polling Efficiently**

AWS Lambda automatically polls DynamoDB Streams every **1 second**. The polling is:  
✅ **Managed by AWS**—You don’t need to handle polling logic.  
✅ **Optimized for Cost**—You don’t pay for the polling itself.  
✅ **Scalable**—AWS Lambda multiple shards and scales as needed.

📌 **If no new data is available, AWS Lambda does nothing—no unnecessary execution!**

## 💰 **Cost of Reading DynamoDB Streams**

### ✅ **DynamoDB Streams are Free to Enable**

DynamoDB Streams do **not charge for enabling or storing stream records** for the **first 24 hours**.

🔹 **However, reading from DynamoDB Streams incurs costs depending on the AWS service used for polling.**  
Let’s break it down.

---

## 🔄 **How DynamoDB Stream Reads Are Charged**

DynamoDB Streams use **Read Request Units (RRUs)** for reading stream records.

📌 **Cost per Read Request:**

- **\$0.02 per 100,000 read request units (RRUs)**
- **Each RRU can return up to 1 MB of stream data**

🔹 **Formula for Estimating Read Costs:**

```plaintext
Total Cost = (Total Streamed Data in MB ÷ 1MB) × ($0.02 ÷ 100,000)
```

---

## 🔍 **Example Read Costs for DynamoDB Streams**

| **Stream Data Volume (Per Month)** | **Total Read Requests (RRUs)** | **Monthly Cost** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **10 GB of stream data**           | `(10GB ÷ 1MB) = 10,000` RRUs   | **\$0.002**      |
| **100 GB of stream data**          | `(100GB ÷ 1MB) = 100,000` RRUs | **\$2**          |
| **1 TB of stream data**            | `(1TB ÷ 1MB) = 1,000,000` RRUs | **\$20**         |

✅ **Key Takeaway:**  
DynamoDB Stream read costs are **very low** unless dealing with **high-volume real-time streaming**.

## 🚀 **How AWS Services Affect Stream Read Costs**

**Different AWS services interact with DynamoDB Streams and may introduce additional costs:**

| **AWS Service**       | **How It Reads the Stream?**                                | **Extra Costs?**                                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Lambda**        | **AWS polls every second, triggers Lambda on new events**   | **No additional read costs (AWS manages polling for free)** |
| **Amazon Kinesis**    | **Kinesis polls stream records for analytics**              | **Kinesis processing costs apply**                          |
| **AWS Glue**          | **Glue ETL jobs read from the stream for batch processing** | **Glue job costs apply**                                    |
| **EC2 / Custom Apps** | **Custom polling logic using SDK (DynamoDB API calls)**     | **API requests consume read request units**                 |

📌 **Using Lambda is the most cost-effective because AWS handles polling for free!**

## 🎯 **Best Practices to Reduce Costs**

✔ **Use AWS Lambda to process streams (free polling)**.  
✔ **Use `BatchSize` in Lambda to process multiple records per execution**.  
✔ **Filter stream data at the source to reduce unnecessary reads**.  
✔ **Use Amazon Kinesis only if dealing with high-throughput analytics.**

---

## 🎯 **Final Thoughts**

✔ **DynamoDB Streams uses a PULL mechanism, but AWS manages polling for you.**  
✔ **Instead of implementing a manual polling system, use AWS Lambda for event-driven execution.**  
✔ **For high-volume processing, Kinesis is a better choice than Lambda.**  
✔ **Use EventBridge for real-time notifications and push-based workflows.**  
✔ **AWS handles shard ordering and parallel processing to ensure scalability.**

✔ **DynamoDB Stream reads cost \$0.02 per 100,000 read requests**.  
✔ **Each read request retrieves up to 1MB of data**.  
✔ **AWS Lambda processes streams without additional read costs** (polling is free).  
✔ **For high-throughput streaming, Amazon Kinesis and Glue have extra processing costs**.

📌 **For most event-driven applications, AWS Lambda is the best cost-efficient way to consume DynamoDB Streams!** 🚀
