# 🌍 **DynamoDB Global Tables: Multi-Region Data Replication**

## 📌 **What is a DynamoDB Global Table?**

A **Global Table** in DynamoDB is a **fully managed, multi-region, multi-active database** that allows you to **automatically replicate** data across multiple AWS regions for **low-latency access** and **disaster recovery**.

🔹 **Key Features:**

- **Active-Active Replication**: Read and write to any region, and changes are automatically replicated.
- **Asynchronous Replication**: Changes are replicated within milliseconds to seconds across regions.
- **Low-Latency Access**: Users get faster access by reading data from the nearest AWS region.
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: Uses **last writer wins** conflict resolution.
- **Disaster Recovery**: If one region goes down, the application can use another region.
- **No Additional Code Required**: AWS manages replication seamlessly.

> 💡 Global Tables Require DynamoDB Streams to be enabled.  
> 💡 Global Tables Require auto scaling enabled for provisioned capacity mode or on-demand capacity mode.

## 🏗 **How DynamoDB Global Tables Work**

1️⃣ **User writes data to Region A**  
2️⃣ **DynamoDB replicates Asynchronous within milliseconds to seconds the changes to Region B, C, etc.**  
3️⃣ **Users in other regions can read or write from the nearest region**  
4️⃣ **If Region A fails, traffic is routed to another region**

✅ **Example Setup:**

- **Primary Region**: `us-east-1` (Virginia)
- **Secondary Regions**: `eu-west-1` (Ireland), `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore)

## 🔄 **How Writes & Reads Work in Global Tables**

| **Action**              | **What Happens?**                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Write**               | Data is written to the nearest region and replicated to all others. |
| **Read**                | Queries are routed to the closest region for low-latency access.    |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Last writer wins (`timestamp-based`).                                 |

## 🏗 **Creating a Global Table**

### ✅ **Step 1: Create a Table in One Region**

Run the following command to create a table in **`us-east-1`**:

```sh
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name Orders \
    --attribute-definitions \
        AttributeName=OrderID,AttributeType=S \
        AttributeName=CustomerID,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema \
        AttributeName=OrderID,KeyType=HASH \
        AttributeName=CustomerID,KeyType=RANGE \
    --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST \
    --region us-east-1
```

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Enable Global Table Replication**

Once the table is created, add replication to **`eu-west-1` (Ireland)** and **`ap-southeast-1` (Singapore)**:

```sh
aws dynamodb update-table \
    --table-name Orders \
    --replica-updates \
        '[{"Create": {"RegionName": "eu-west-1"}}, {"Create": {"RegionName": "ap-southeast-1"}}]'
```

📌 **Now, DynamoDB will handle multi-region replication automatically!** 🚀

## 🛠 **Handling Write Conflicts in Global Tables**

Since multiple regions **can write to the table simultaneously**, DynamoDB uses a **"Last Writer Wins"** strategy:

- Each item has a **timestamp**.
- If two regions write the same item, the one with the **newest timestamp** wins.

🔹 **Example Conflict Scenario:**

| **Region**  | **Write Operation**         | **Timestamp** | **Final Stored Value** |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| `us-east-1` | `OrderStatus = "Shipped"`   | `10:01 AM`    | ❌ Overwritten         |
| `eu-west-1` | `OrderStatus = "Delivered"` | `10:02 AM`    | ✅ Kept (latest)       |

---

## 🚀 **Example: Writing & Reading from a Global Table**

### ✅ **Write to Any Region**

```sh
aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name Orders \
    --item '{
        "OrderID": {"S": "12345"},
        "CustomerID": {"S": "User567"},
        "OrderStatus": {"S": "Processing"},
        "Timestamp": {"N": "1700000000"}
    }' \
    --region eu-west-1
```

### ✅ **Read from Another Region**

```sh
aws dynamodb get-item \
    --table-name Orders \
    --key '{
        "OrderID": {"S": "12345"},
        "CustomerID": {"S": "User567"}
    }' \
    --region us-east-1
```

📌 **Since Global Tables replicate data across regions, the order is accessible from `us-east-1` even though it was written in `eu-west-1`.**

## 🎯 **Best Practices for Global Tables**

✔ **Use the closest region** for lowest read latency.  
✔ **Handle write conflicts** by designing applications to avoid conflicting writes.  
✔ **Use DynamoDB Streams** to track updates in multiple regions.  
✔ **Ensure strong consistency** by always writing timestamps with items.

---

## 🔥 **Key Takeaways**

✔ **DynamoDB Global Tables replicate data across multiple regions automatically.**  
✔ **All regions can accept writes, and replication happens asynchronously.**  
✔ **Last writer wins in case of conflicts.**  
✔ **Disaster recovery and failover are built-in, improving application resilience.**

With **Global Tables**, you can **build globally distributed applications** with **low latency and high availability**—without managing complex infrastructure! 🚀
