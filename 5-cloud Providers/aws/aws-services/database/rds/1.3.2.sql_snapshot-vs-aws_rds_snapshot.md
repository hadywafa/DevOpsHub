# 🌱 Root: The Real Difference Between SQL Server Snapshots and AWS RDS Snapshots

The **main confusion** is that **SQL Server Snapshots** and **AWS RDS Snapshots** use the same word but work **completely differently**! Let’s break them down clearly.

---

## 📸 **1. SQL Server Snapshots (Copy-on-Write Mechanism)**

✅ **NOT a Full Copy** of the Database  
✅ **Only Stores Changed Pages** (Using Sparse Files)  
✅ **Fast Rollback, But Not a Backup**

### 🔄 How It Works

- SQL Server **does not copy the full database** when a snapshot is created.
- It creates a **sparse file** (which starts empty).
- When a data page **changes**, the **old version of the page** is copied to the snapshot.
- If you restore from a snapshot, **only changed pages are overwritten**.

💡 **SQL Server Snapshots are NOT backups!** If the main database is deleted, the snapshot is useless.

---

## 📸 **2. AWS RDS Snapshots (Full Storage Copy)**

✅ **A Full Copy of the Database at a Specific Time**  
✅ **Stored in S3 as a Backup**  
✅ **Allows Full Restoration to Another Instance**

### 🔄 How It Works

- AWS **copies the entire database storage** (not just changed pages).
- The snapshot **is stored in Amazon S3** as a complete backup.
- You can **restore from it anytime**, but **you don’t get point-in-time recovery**.

💡 **AWS RDS Snapshots are like full backups!** If the main database is deleted, you can still restore from a snapshot.

| Feature                         | **SQL Server Snapshot** 📸  | **AWS RDS Snapshot** 📸   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **What It Stores?**             | Only changed pages          | Full database copy        |
| **Copy-on-Write?**              | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                     |
| **Used for Quick Rollback?**    | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                     |
| **Used for Disaster Recovery?** | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Stored Externally?**          | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes (S3)               |
| **Restores a New Database?**    | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Point-in-Time Recovery?**     | ❌ No                       | ❌ No                     |
| **Incremental?**                | ✅ Yes (only changed pages) | ❌ No (full storage copy) |

## 🔄 **3. AWS RDS Backups (Automated Point-in-Time Recovery)**

✅ **Automated, Daily Full Backups**  
✅ **Stores Transaction Logs Every 5 Minutes**  
✅ **Allows Precise Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**

### 🔄 How It Works

- AWS **automatically** backs up the full database daily.
- Then, it **keeps track of all transaction logs** every 5 minutes.
- If you restore, AWS **restores the full backup** and **applies the logs** up to the exact second you need.

💡 **AWS Automated Backups are for point-in-time recovery, unlike RDS Snapshots which restore only to a fixed time.**

| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **What It Stores?**           | Full database copy      | Full DB + Transaction Logs      |
| **Incremental?**              | ❌ No (Full)            | ✅ Yes (After First Backup)     |
| **Point-in-Time Recovery?**   | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Restores to Exact Second?** | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Stored in S3?**             | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Retention Period**          | Until deleted manually  | Up to 35 days                   |

## 🔥 **Final Summary**

🚀 **SQL Server Snapshots** = **Fast rollback, stores only changed pages, not a real backup.**  
🚀 **AWS RDS Snapshots** = **Full database copy, a real backup, but no point-in-time recovery.**  
🚀 **AWS RDS Automated Backups** = **Full backup + transaction logs, allows point-in-time recovery.**

💡 **If you need to restore data to an exact second, use RDS Automated Backups.**  
💡 **If you want a full backup at a fixed time, use an RDS Snapshot.**  
💡 **If you want a quick rollback inside SQL Server, use SQL Server Snapshots.**
