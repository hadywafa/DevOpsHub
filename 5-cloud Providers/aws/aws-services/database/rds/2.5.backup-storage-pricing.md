# **💰 Amazon RDS – Backup Storage Pricing**

Amazon RDS offers backup storage options to ensure the safety of your data, with clear pricing based on your usage. Here’s a breakdown of how Amazon RDS calculates backup storage charges:

## **🎁 Free Tier**

- **20 GB of General Purpose (SSD) DB storage**.
- **20 GB of storage** for automated database backups and any **user-initiated DB snapshots**.

These free allocations are available for each AWS region and are included in the pricing with no additional charges.

## **🔖 Charges for Backup Storage**

- You are charged only for backup storage that **exceeds the total DB storage** allocation you have in a region.
- The pricing is based on the **amount of storage retained for backups** beyond the allocated storage for your RDS instance.

### **✍️ Example**

Assume you have the following configuration for your RDS MySQL instance:

- **Total DB storage**: 100 GB
- **Automated snapshots**: 75 GB
- **Manual backups**: 50 GB

In this scenario:

- **Total backup storage used**: 75 GB (automated) + 50 GB (manual) = 125 GB
- **Charges**: You will be charged for the storage exceeding the allocated 100 GB, which is **25 GB** (125 GB - 100 GB).

## **🔑 Key Points to Remember**

- **Free storage** for backups is limited to `20 GB per region`.
- **Charges apply** `only to the storage used for backups that exceeds your allocated RDS instance storage`.
- Ensure you regularly manage and delete unnecessary backups to avoid unexpected storage costs.
