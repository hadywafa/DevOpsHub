# **🌍 Amazon RDS – Multi-AZ DB Cluster Deployment for MySQL & PostgreSQL**

Amazon **RDS Multi-AZ DB Cluster Deployment** provides **high availability, automatic failover, and improved read performance** for **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** databases. This architecture ensures **resilient and scalable** database operations by maintaining a **primary instance** and **two readable standbys** across multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**.

## **🛠 What is Multi-AZ DB Cluster Deployment?**

A **Multi-AZ DB Cluster** consists of:

- **📝 Primary DB Instance (Writer):** Handles **all write** and **transactional** operations.
- **📖 Readable Standby Instances (2 Replicas):** Serve **read queries** and act as **failover targets**.
- **🔄 Automatic Failover:** If the **primary fails**, RDS **automatically promotes** one standby as the new **primary** (failover occurs in **under 35 seconds**).
- **📡 Semi-Synchronous Replication:** Changes must be **acknowledged by at least one standby** before committing.

---

## **📦 Deployment Options & Availability**

✅ **Supported Engines:** **MySQL 8.0.28+** | **PostgreSQL 13.4+**  
✅ **Redundancy:** **Data is replicated across three AZs.**  
✅ **Performance Boost:** **Up to 2x faster** commit latency compared to other Multi-AZ deployments.

### **🔹 How Multi-AZ DB Cluster Works**

1️⃣ **Applications connect to the Cluster Endpoint** for writes.  
2️⃣ **Replication happens between Primary and Standbys** (Semi-Synchronous).  
3️⃣ **Read traffic is distributed using the Reader Endpoint** (Async replication).  
4️⃣ **In case of failure, one reader is promoted to primary** automatically.

## **🚀 Key Features of Multi-AZ DB Cluster Deployment**

### **🔗 1. Cluster Endpoints**

- **✍️ Cluster Endpoint (Writes)** → Directs traffic to the primary DB instance.
- **📖 Reader Endpoint (Reads)** → Distributes read queries across the **two readable standbys**.

### **🔄 2. Automatic Failover & High Availability**

- **📉 Failover time: ~35 seconds** (Minimal downtime).
- **🔄 No manual intervention required**—AWS automatically promotes a new primary.
- **✅ Readers become writable during failover**.

### **📡 3. Replication Model**

- **📌 Semi-Synchronous Replication:** Primary waits for **one standby to acknowledge** writes.
- **📌 Asynchronous Replication:** Second standby receives updates **without delaying transactions**.

### **📷 4. Snapshots & Restorations**

- **📍 Automated backups & snapshots are supported**.
- **📤 Snapshots can be restored to create new Multi-AZ clusters**.

## **⚠️ Limitations of Multi-AZ DB Clusters**

While **Multi-AZ DB Clusters** offer many advantages, there are a few **limitations** to consider:

| ❌ **Not Supported Features** | ❗ Details                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🚫 RDS Proxy**              | **Not compatible** with Multi-AZ Clusters.                    |
| **🚫 IAM DB Authentication**  | Only **user-based authentication** is allowed.                |
| **🚫 Dual Stack (IPv6)**      | Supports **only IPv4 networking**.                            |
| **🚫 Export to S3**           | Cannot export **snapshots to Amazon S3**.                     |
| **🚫 Read Replicas**          | **No additional read replicas** beyond the built-in standbys. |
| **🚫 Storage Autoscaling**    | **Storage size must be managed manually.**                    |
