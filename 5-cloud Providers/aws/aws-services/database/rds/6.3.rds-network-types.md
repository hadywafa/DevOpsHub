# **📌 Conclusion: RDS Network Types 🌐**

Amazon **RDS (Relational Database Service)** offers two network types for database communication:

✅ **IPv4-Only Mode** – Supports traditional IPv4 networking, suitable for most AWS services and legacy applications.  
✅ **Dual-Stack Mode (IPv4 & IPv6)** – Allows communication over **both** IPv4 and IPv6, enabling **future-proofing** and **compatibility with IPv6-only clients**.

## **🛠 Choosing the Right Network Type**

| Scenario                                       | Best Network Type |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Your application only supports IPv4**        | **IPv4-Only** ✅  |
| **You have clients that use IPv6**             | **Dual-Stack** ✅ |
| **You want future-proofing with IPv6 support** | **Dual-Stack** ✅ |

## **💡 RDS Multi-AZ Considerations**

| Deployment Type                               | Dual-Stack Support? | Why?                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-AZ DB Instance**                     | ✅ Yes              | Standard instance with a single endpoint                            |
| **Multi-AZ DB Instance (2 instances)**        | ✅ Yes              | Uses **DNS-based failover**, compatible with IPv6                   |
| **Multi-AZ DB Cluster (1 writer, 2 readers)** | ❌ No               | Uses **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)**, which are **IPv4-only** |

## **🚀 Key Takeaways**

✔ **Choose IPv4-only if your system doesn’t need IPv6.**  
✔ **Use Dual-Stack Mode if you have IPv6-dependent clients or want future IPv6 readiness.**  
✔ **Multi-AZ DB Clusters do NOT support Dual-Stack Mode** because they rely on **IPv4-based ENI failover.**  
✔ **For IPv6 compatibility, use Single-AZ or Multi-AZ DB Instance deployments instead.**

💡 **Final Tip:** If unsure, use **Dual-Stack Mode** to future-proof your architecture while keeping IPv4 compatibility! 🚀
