# **Amazon RDS on AWS Outposts üè†**

Amazon RDS on AWS Outposts extends the power of AWS-managed databases to on-premises environments, allowing you to run fully managed databases closer to your on-premises applications. By combining the benefits of AWS RDS and the flexibility of Outposts, businesses can enjoy a hybrid cloud environment with seamless integration, low latency, and enhanced scalability.

## **Key Features of Amazon RDS on AWS Outposts ‚öôÔ∏è**

### **1. Fully Managed Databases Close to On-Premises Applications üîê**

- Amazon RDS on AWS Outposts brings RDS databases (such as MS SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL) closer to the on-premises applications that require low-latency database access.
- This allows for high-performance databases and ensures that workloads running on-premises can integrate seamlessly with AWS services.

### **2. Automated Backups & Transaction Logs üì¶**

- RDS on Outposts supports automated backups of your database, ensuring your data is securely stored and protected.
- All backups and transaction logs are stored in the AWS region, giving you the flexibility and scalability of AWS‚Äôs cloud infrastructure even when running your database on-premises.

### **3. RDS Encryption at Rest üîê**

- As with all RDS instances, data is encrypted at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys, providing robust data protection.

### **4. Network Connectivity Requirement üåê**

- AWS Outposts requires network connectivity between your on-premises location and the AWS region to ensure smooth operation.
- This network connection is essential for syncing data and transaction logs between your on-premises and AWS region.

### **5. DNS Management with Route 53 üåç**

- Amazon RDS on Outposts leverages Amazon Route 53 to resolve DNS hostnames for your database.
- You can also configure DNS locally on-premises, ensuring the database continues to work even if network connectivity to the AWS region is lost.

### **6. Multi-AZ Support for High Availability üíº**

- Multi-AZ deployments are supported, which means RDS automatically provisions a standby instance in a second Outpost to ensure high availability.
- In the event of a failure in the primary Outpost, RDS can automatically failover to the standby instance in the second Outpost.
