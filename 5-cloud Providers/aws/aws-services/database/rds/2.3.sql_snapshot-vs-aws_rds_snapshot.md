# 🧠 **AWS RDS Backups vs Snapshots**

The **main confusion** is that **SQL Server Snapshots** and **AWS RDS Snapshots** use the same word but work **completely differently**! Let’s break them down clearly.

---

## 📂 Part 1: Understanding RDS Backups & Snapshots

### 🔄 **1. Automated Backups (PITR)**

> 📖 AWS Equivalent of:  
> ✅ SQL Server **Full Backup + Transaction Log Backups**

#### ✅ What It Does

- AWS automatically:
  - Takes a **full daily backup**
  - Captures **transaction logs every 5 minutes**
- Lets you **restore to any point in time** in your configured retention window (1–35 days).

#### 🧠 Think of it like

> "Full + transaction log backups" that AWS manages for you, continuously in the background.

#### 🛠 You don’t control

- When the backups happen (they are daily and automatic)
- The granularity of transaction logs (fixed at 5-minute intervals)

#### 🔁 When You Restore

- You **restore a new RDS instance** to the point in time you choose.
- PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) works just like SQL Server’s `RESTORE DATABASE` with logs.

---

### 📸 **2. Manual Snapshots**

> 📖 AWS Equivalent of:  
> ✅ SQL Server **Manual Full Backup** (at a fixed time)

#### ✅ What It Does

- You manually trigger a **full backup** of the current RDS DB.
- You **control the retention** (they never expire unless you delete them).
- You can **share or copy** these across accounts or regions.

#### 🧠 Think of it like

> "I'm doing a full backup right now and saving it as a frozen copy."

#### ❌ Limitations

- No transaction logs = **no point-in-time recovery**
- You can only restore to **the exact time** when the snapshot was taken

## 📘 Part 2: SQL Server vs RDS Terms Side-by-Side

| 🔍 Purpose                      | **SQL Server Term**                       | **AWS RDS Equivalent**                      |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Full backup of DB               | Full Backup                               | Manual Snapshot (User-Initiated)            |
| Automatic backups + PITR        | Full + Log Backups + PITR                 | Automated Backups + Transaction Logs        |
| Restore to a specific time      | RESTORE + STOPAT                          | PITR with Automated Backups                 |
| Snapshot (same disk, not full)  | SQL Snapshot (Sparse File, Copy-on-Write) | ❌ Not available in AWS (totally different) |
| Copy backup to other region     | Backup file transfer                      | Snapshot Copy (Cross-Region)                |
| Share backup to another account | Backup export                             | Snapshot Sharing                            |

> 🧠 SQL Snapshots ≠ AWS Snapshots.  
> SQL Snapshots are like _copy-on-write_ markers.  
> AWS Snapshots are _full database copies_ stored in S3.

## 🪄 What Makes It Confusing in AWS?

1. **AWS calls a daily automated full backup an “automated snapshot” sometimes**  
   → But it’s part of the **automated backup system**, **not a real “snapshot”** that you manage.

2. **Snapshots vs Backups seem similar**  
   → But **only automated backups** support **PITR** using transaction logs.  
   → **Manual snapshots** are just frozen full copies.

3. **RDS doesn’t give you access to actual files like `.bak` or `.trn`**  
   → It’s all internal, stored in S3, and managed by AWS APIs.

## 🛠 When Should I Use What?

| Scenario                                | Use Automated Backup 🔄 | Use Manual Snapshot 📸             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Point-in-time recovery after corruption | ✅ Yes                  | ❌ No                              |
| Prepare for risky DB upgrade            | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes (Take snapshot first)       |
| Clone DB for testing                    | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes (Take and restore snapshot) |
| Archive copy for long-term retention    | ❌ No (auto-deletes)    | ✅ Yes                             |
| Share backup across AWS accounts        | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes                             |
| Cross-region disaster recovery          | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes (copy snapshot)             |
| Fully managed daily backup              | ✅ Yes                  | ❌ No (manual effort)              |

## 🧪 Real-World Example

Let’s say you’re running an RDS instance for production:

- 🟢 **AWS Automated Backups** are enabled (7-day PITR):

  - You can recover to **any second** in the past 7 days.
  - Think of this as your **insurance policy**.

- 🟡 Before a big app update:

  - You **create a manual snapshot**.
  - If something breaks, you can **restore to that exact state**.

- 🔵 For monthly compliance:
  - You copy snapshots to another region/account for backup **archiving**.

## 🏁 TL;DR – Final Summary

| Feature                     | **Automated Backup** 🔄             | **Manual Snapshot** 📸              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| How it's triggered          | Automatically by AWS                | Manually by you                     |
| Can restore to any second?  | ✅ Yes (PITR with transaction logs) | ❌ No (only to snapshot timestamp)  |
| Lifespan                    | Up to 35 days                       | Forever (until you delete it)       |
| Copy to other region        | ✅ Yes                              | ✅ Yes                              |
| Share with other account    | ❌ No                               | ✅ Yes                              |
| Can be automated?           | Via AWS Backup or SDK               | Yes (but still manual API call)     |
| Used for daily DR coverage? | ✅ Best choice                      | ❌ Only for specific backup moments |
| Similar to SQL Server       | Full + Log + PITR                   | Manual Full Backup                  |

> 🧠 **If you need to restore data to an exact second, use RDS Automated Backups.**  
> 🧠 **If you want a full backup at a fixed time, use an RDS Snapshot.**  
> 🧠 **If you want a quick rollback inside SQL Server, use SQL Server Snapshots.**
