# 🏗 **Aurora Architecture**

Amazon Aurora is a **cloud-native relational database** designed for **high availability, scalability, and performance**. Unlike traditional relational database systems, **Aurora separates compute from storage**, making it more resilient and efficient.

---

## 📌 **1️⃣ Core Architectural Components of Aurora**

Amazon Aurora consists of **two main layers**:

### **🔹 1. Compute Layer (Database Instances)**

- Handles **SQL processing, query execution, and transactions**.
- Supports **Aurora PostgreSQL and Aurora MySQL**.
- Instances **do not store data locally**—all data is managed in the **shared storage layer**.
- Supports **multiple read replicas (up to 15 per region)** .
- **Failover is automatic**—if the writer instance fails, a read replica is promoted.

### **🔹 2. Storage Layer (Distributed, Shared Storage)**

- **Fully managed, distributed, and replicated storage** across **3 AWS Availability Zones (AZs)**.
- **Auto-scales from 10GB to 128TiB** without downtime.
- **Stores data in 10GB protection groups**, each one **replicated 6 times** (2 per AZ) for fault tolerance.
- Uses **Quorum-based replication** (4 out of 6 storage nodes must confirm a write).
- **No WAL shipping**—writes are stored in **redo logs directly in the storage layer**.

---

## 🔄 **2️⃣ How Aurora Handles Reads & Writes**

### **✍️ Aurora Write Process**

✔ Writes happen **only in the primary (writer) instance**.  
✔ **No WAL (Write-Ahead Log) shipping**—instead, **Aurora stores redo logs in shared storage**.  
✔ **Writes are sent to 6 storage nodes (2 per AZ)**.  
✔ A write is **confirmed when at least 4 out of 6 nodes** acknowledge it.

    participant Client as Client
    participant Primary as Aurora Primary DB (Writer)
    participant Storage1 as Storage Node (AZ1)
    participant Storage2 as Storage Node (AZ1)
    participant Storage3 as Storage Node (AZ2)
    participant Storage4 as Storage Node (AZ2)
    participant Storage5 as Storage Node (AZ3)
    participant Storage6 as Storage Node (AZ3)

    Client->>Primary: Write Request (INSERT/UPDATE)
    Primary->>Storage1: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage2: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage3: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage4: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage5: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage6: Send Redo Log

    Storage1-->>Primary: ACK (Confirmed)
    Storage2-->>Primary: ACK (Confirmed)
    Storage3-->>Primary: ACK (Confirmed)
    Storage4-->>Primary: ACK (Confirmed)
    Storage5--X Primary: Timeout
    Storage6--X Primary: Timeout

    Primary->>Client: Write Committed (4/6 Quorum Achieved)
```

📌 **Key Takeaways**

- Aurora **does not modify database pages immediately**—it first **stores redo logs in storage nodes**.
- This **reduces I/O overhead and increases performance**.
- Even if **1 or 2 storage nodes fail**, writes continue **without data loss**.

---

### **📖 Aurora Read Process**

✔ Read replicas **do not maintain separate database copies**.  
✔ Instead, all read replicas **query the shared storage layer** directly.  
✔ This **eliminates replication lag** and **allows instant failover**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client
    participant Replica as Aurora Read Replica
    participant Storage as Aurora Shared Storage (Distributed Data)

    Client->>Replica: Read Request (SELECT)
    Replica->>Storage: Fetch Latest Committed Data
    Storage-->>Replica: Return Data (Low-Latency)
    Replica-->>Client: Query Result
```

📌 **Key Takeaways**

- **No need for WAL log replay**—replicas instantly access the same data.
- **Near-zero replication lag** (**<100ms**).
- Up to **15 read replicas** for **high-performance scaling**.

## 🛠 **3️⃣ Aurora Storage System (Distributed & Self-Healing)**

✔ Data is **stored in 10GB protection groups**.  
✔ Each **protection group is replicated 6 times across 3 AZs**.  
✔ Aurora **can rebuild failed storage nodes automatically** without impact.

### **🔹 Quorum-Based Replication**

✔ Each write **must be confirmed by at least 4 out of 6 storage nodes**.  
✔ Ensures **strong consistency and fault tolerance**.

📌 **Why is This Better?**

- In **traditional databases**, storage is tied to a single instance (EBS).
- In **Aurora**, storage is **shared and distributed**, making it **faster and more reliable**.

| Feature               | **Aurora**                                      | **Amazon RDS**                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage Model**     | **Shared, distributed storage (multi-AZ)**      | **EBS-based storage (single AZ per instance)** |
| **Replication**       | **Storage-level replication (no WAL shipping)** | **Streaming WAL logs to replicas**             |
| **Replication Lag**   | **Milliseconds (<100ms)**                       | **Seconds to minutes**                         |
| **Failover Time**     | **~30 seconds**                                 | **60-120 seconds**                             |
| **Read Replicas**     | **Up to 15, zero-lag**                          | **Up to 5, replication lag exists**            |
| **Storage Scaling**   | **Auto-scales to 128TiB**                       | **Manual resizing required**                   |
| **Backup & Recovery** | **Continuous, no performance impact**           | **Daily snapshots (affects performance)**      |

📌 **Key Takeaways**
✔ **Aurora eliminates replication lag by sharing a single storage layer.**  
✔ **Aurora failover is ~30s, RDS failover takes ~1-2 minutes.**  
✔ **Aurora scales automatically, RDS requires manual resizing.**
