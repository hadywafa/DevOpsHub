# 📂 **Amazon Aurora Storage Layer**

Amazon Aurora’s **storage architecture is fundamentally different** from traditional RDBMS storage. Instead of relying on **local EBS volumes**, Aurora employs a **distributed, multi-tenant storage layer** that separates **compute (database instances) from storage**, enabling **high availability, automatic scaling, and near-instant replication**.

---

## 📌 **1️⃣ What Makes Aurora’s Storage Unique?**

Aurora’s **storage layer is shared across all instances in a cluster** and is designed to be **highly available, fault-tolerant, and self-healing**.

### 🔹 **Key Features of Aurora’s Storage Layer**

- ✔ **Shared Storage** – The database **instances do not store data locally**; they access a **distributed storage volume** spanning **multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs)**.
- ✔ **10GB Protection Groups** – Data is **partitioned into 10GB storage segments (protection groups)** for **efficient scaling** and **replication**.
- ✔ **6-Way Replication** – Each **10GB segment is automatically replicated 6 times across 3 AZs** for durability.
- ✔ **Auto-Scaling Storage** – Grows **from 10GB to 128TiB** dynamically, eliminating manual resizing.
- ✔ **No WAL Shipping** – Instead of traditional **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**, **Aurora applies redo logs at the storage layer**, significantly reducing replication lag.
- ✔ **Quorum-Based Writes** – A write is **considered committed only when at least 4 out of 6 storage nodes acknowledge it**, ensuring strong consistency.

📌 **How This Differs from Traditional RDS**

- In **traditional RDS**, every DB instance has its own **dedicated EBS volume**, requiring **manual replication and WAL shipping**.
- In **Aurora**, storage is **fully decoupled from compute**, providing **instant replication across read replicas with near-zero lag (<100ms)**.

## 🔄 **2️⃣ How Aurora’s Storage Layer Works**

Aurora’s **storage nodes operate independently from database instances** and handle **data persistence, replication, and recovery** seamlessly.

### **🔹 Aurora Write Process**

✔ **Writes happen only on the primary (writer) instance**.  
✔ Aurora **does not write full database pages immediately**—instead, it **writes only redo log records** to the storage layer.  
✔ The **redo logs are sent to 6 storage nodes across 3 AZs** for durability.  
✔ A transaction **commits only when at least 4 out of 6 storage nodes acknowledge the write**.

    participant Storage3 as Storage Node (AZ2)
    participant Storage4 as Storage Node (AZ2)
    participant Storage5 as Storage Node (AZ3)
    participant Storage6 as Storage Node (AZ3)

    Client->>Primary: Write Request (INSERT/UPDATE)
    Primary->>Storage1: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage2: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage3: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage4: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage5: Send Redo Log
    Primary->>Storage6: Send Redo Log

    Storage1-->>Primary: ACK (Confirmed)
    Storage2-->>Primary: ACK (Confirmed)
    Storage3-->>Primary: ACK (Confirmed)
    Storage4-->>Primary: ACK (Confirmed)
    Storage5--X Primary: Timeout
    Storage6--X Primary: Timeout

    Primary->>Client: Write Committed (4/6 Quorum Achieved)
```

📌 **Key Takeaways**

- Aurora **only writes redo logs** to storage, reducing **disk I/O overhead** and improving performance.
- **No full-page writes**—data pages are reconstructed **asynchronously** by storage nodes when needed.
- **If a node fails**, Aurora **rebuilds missing data from other nodes** without downtime.

### **🔹 Aurora Read Process**

✔ **Aurora read replicas do not maintain separate copies of the database**.  
✔ Instead, they **directly access the same shared storage layer**.  
✔ Since there is **no need for WAL log shipping**, replication **happens in real-time (<100ms lag)**.

```mermaid

    participant Client as Client
    participant Replica as Aurora Read Replica
    participant Storage as Aurora Shared Storage (Distributed Data)

    Client->>Replica: Read Request (SELECT)
    Replica->>Storage: Fetch Latest Committed Data
    Storage-->>Replica: Return Data (Low-Latency)
    Replica-->>Client: Query Result
```

📌 **Key Takeaways**

- **No separate database copies**—all replicas access the **same storage layer**.
- **Near-zero replication lag** (**<100ms**), unlike traditional read replicas that rely on WAL-based replication.
- **Failover is nearly instant (~30s)** since **read replicas already have access to the latest data**.

## 🔀 **3️⃣ How Aurora Syncs Writes & Reads Across Storage Nodes**

### 🔹 **Quorum-Based Write System**

✔ **Each write must be confirmed by at least 4 out of 6 storage nodes**.  
✔ If a node **fails or lags**, the remaining nodes continue processing.  
✔ This ensures **strong consistency** without sacrificing performance.

### 🔹 **Instant Read Scaling**

✔ Since **read replicas query the same storage layer**, they do **not require data replication**.  
✔ This allows **up to 15 replicas** with **real-time updates**.  
✔ Aurora **automatically balances read requests across replicas**, improving performance.

📌 **Comparison with Traditional Replication**

| **Feature**         | **Aurora (Shared Storage)**               | **Traditional RDS (EBS-based)**         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Replication Lag** | **Milliseconds (<100ms)**                 | **Seconds to minutes**                  |
| **Failover Time**   | **~30 seconds**                           | **60-120 seconds**                      |
| **Read Scaling**    | **Up to 15 replicas, zero lag**           | **Up to 5 replicas, replication delay** |
| **Write Process**   | **Redo log writes, not full-page writes** | **Writes entire data pages**            |

## 🔄 **4️⃣ What Happens If a Storage Node Fails?**

Aurora’s **storage layer is self-healing** and **fault-tolerant**, capable of handling multiple failures.

### **✔ Storage Node Failure Recovery**

- If **one storage node fails**, **Aurora reconstructs the missing data from the other 5 copies**.
- **Replication happens automatically**—a new node is assigned and rebuilt **within minutes**.

### **✔ Availability Zone (AZ) Failure Recovery**

- Aurora **can survive the complete failure of an AZ** without losing data.
- Since **data is already replicated across 3 AZs**, it continues processing **without intervention**.

📌 **This means:** Aurora’s **architecture provides better durability** than **RAID, EBS, or traditional replication**.
