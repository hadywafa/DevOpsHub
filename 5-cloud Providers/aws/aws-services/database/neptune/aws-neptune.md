## üåü **Key Features of AWS Neptune**

1. **Graph Database**:

   - Purpose-built for storing and querying highly connected data.
   - Supports both **property graphs** (using Gremlin) and **RDF graphs** (using SPARQL).

2. **High Availability and Durability**:

   - Automatically replicates data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
   - Ensures durability and fault tolerance with automatic failover.

3. **Cluster Architecture**:

   - One **primary instance** handles writes and up to **15 Read Replicas** distribute reads for high performance.

4. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Operates within a customer's **VPC** for secure network isolation.
   - Supports automated backups to Amazon S3 for recovery.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How AWS Neptune Works**

1. **Primary Instance**:

   - Handles **write operations** and replicates data to read replicas.

2. **Read Replicas**:

   - Distribute **read workloads** to improve query performance.
   - Provide automatic failover in case the primary instance fails.

3. **Cluster Volume**:

   - Data is stored in a shared, fault-tolerant **cluster volume** accessible by all instances.

4. **Query Languages**:
   - Use **Gremlin** for navigating property graphs and **SPARQL** for querying RDF graphs.
