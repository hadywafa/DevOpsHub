## 📝 **What is Apache Cassandra?**

Apache Cassandra is an **open-source, distributed NoSQL database** known for its scalability and fault tolerance. It is designed to handle large volumes of data across many servers with no single point of failure.

### Key Characteristics

- **Columnar Database**: Data is stored in columns, making it efficient for analytical queries.
- **Unstructured Data**: Handles flexible, schema-less data models.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Data is replicated across multiple nodes in a cluster.
- **Cassandra Query Language (CQL)**: Used to interact with the database.
