# AWS Best Practices - Architecture For The Cloud

## 1.Use Higher Level Managed Resources

## 2.Optimize for Cost

- Be mindful of the cost of the architecture on AWS.

## 3.Scalability

## 4.Disposable resources instead of fixed servers (Immutable Infrastructures)

  to launch new resources instead of patching existing resources.

## 5.Loose coupling

- Reduce dependencies between workload components.

## 6.Services, Not Servers

- Use Managed Services and Serverless when possible.

## 7.Managing Increasing Volumes of Data

- Data Lakes

## 8.Removing Single Points of Failure

- Automate recovery and reduce disruptions.
- High Availability, Health checks, Fault Tolerance, Multi Regions.

## 9.Caching
