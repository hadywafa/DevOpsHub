## **1. Landing Zone üõ¨**

![Landing Zone](images/landing-zone.png)

The **Landing Zone** is the foundation of AWS Control Tower. It‚Äôs a pre-configured environment designed for managing multiple AWS accounts securely.

- **What‚Äôs Included in the Landing Zone?**

  1. **Management Account**: The central account used to manage the AWS environment.
  2. **Shared Accounts**: Pre-created accounts for specific purposes:
     - **Log Archive Account**: Stores logs from all accounts for auditing.
     - **Audit Account**: Used by security teams to monitor and audit activities.
  3. **Organizational Units (OUs)**: Groups of accounts for applying specific rules (e.g., production vs. development).

- **Example**:
  Imagine a company with two teams: Development and Production. AWS Control Tower creates OUs to apply different rules to these teams automatically.

---

## **2. Guardrails üõ°Ô∏è**

![Guardrails](images/guardrails.png)

Guardrails are pre-defined rules that help enforce security and compliance in your accounts. They‚Äôre like **traffic lights** that guide your AWS usage.

- **Types of Guardrails**:

  1. **Preventive Guardrails**: Stop certain actions from happening. For example:
     - Prevent public access to S3 buckets.
  2. **Detective Guardrails**: Monitor for non-compliant actions and alert you. For example:
     - Detect unencrypted EBS volumes.

- **How Guardrails Work**:

  - Guardrails use AWS services like AWS Organizations and AWS Config to enforce and monitor compliance.

- **Example**:
  If a developer tries to make an S3 bucket public, a preventive guardrail will block the action.

---

## **3. Account Factory üè≠**

![Account Factory](images/account-factory.png)

The **Account Factory** is like a **production line** for creating AWS accounts. It simplifies the process by automating the setup of new accounts with pre-configured settings.

- **What It Does**:

  - Creates accounts with default settings, such as network configurations, logging, and security rules.
  - Integrates new accounts into your Landing Zone and applies guardrails automatically.

- **Example**:
  If your company hires a new team, you can quickly create an account for them using the Account Factory.

---

## **4. Dashboard üìä**

The AWS Control Tower **Dashboard** is your central hub for monitoring and managing the environment.

- **What You Can Do**:

  - View the compliance status of your accounts.
  - See which guardrails are enabled.
  - Track non-compliant activities and take corrective actions.

- **Example**:
  If the dashboard shows a non-compliant resource (e.g., an unencrypted database), you can quickly investigate and resolve the issue.
