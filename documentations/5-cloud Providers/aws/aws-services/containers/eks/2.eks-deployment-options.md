# ‚öñÔ∏è EKS-D vs. EKS-A vs. EKS

## What They Are

### üêß **Amazon EKS Distro (EKS-D)**

- **What**: A Kubernetes distribution.
- **Where**: Can be deployed anywhere (on-premises, another cloud, your hardware).
- **Control Plane**: You manage it yourself.
- **Use Case**: You want the same Kubernetes that Amazon EKS uses but with full control.

### üåç **Amazon EKS Anywhere (EKS-A)**

- **What**: A deployment option for Amazon EKS on your infrastructure.
- **Where**: Mainly on-premises.
- **Control Plane**: You manage it, with AWS tools helping.
- **Use Case**: You want Amazon EKS experience on your premises using AWS best practices.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Amazon EKS (Default)**

- **What**: The standard Kubernetes service managed by AWS.
- **Where**: On AWS infrastructure.
- **Control Plane**: Fully managed by AWS.
- **Use Case**: You prefer AWS to manage Kubernetes control plane.

## Types of EKS Deployment

### Using **EC2 Instances**

- **What**: Run Kubernetes nodes on EC2 instances.
- **Control Plane**: Managed by AWS.
- **Worker Nodes**: Managed by you.
- **Use Case**: Control over the worker nodes, AWS manages the control plane.

### Using **AWS Fargate**

- **What**: Serverless Kubernetes.
- **Control Plane**: Managed by AWS.
- **Worker Nodes**: Also managed by AWS (no infrastructure to manage).
- **Use Case**: Simplify everything‚Äîfocus on your applications without managing infrastructure.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature                      | EKS-D                       | EKS-A                | EKS with EC2         | EKS with Fargate            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Managed by**               | You                         | You (with AWS tools) | AWS (control plane)  | AWS (control plane & nodes) |
| **Deployment Environment**   | Any infrastructure          | On-premises          | AWS                  | AWS                         |
| **Control Plane Management** | You                         | You (with AWS tools) | AWS                  | AWS                         |
| **Worker Nodes Management**  | You                         | You                  | You                  | AWS                         |
| **Use Case**                 | Flexibility & Customization | Hybrid & On-premises | Managed worker nodes | Fully serverless            |

## Control Plane and Worker Nodes

### Control Plane

- **EKS-D**: You manage it.
- **EKS-A**: You manage it, AWS helps with tools.
- **EKS with EC2**: AWS manages it.
- **EKS with Fargate**: AWS manages it.

### Worker Nodes

- **EKS-D**: You manage them.
- **EKS-A**: You manage them.
- **EKS with EC2**: You manage them.
- **EKS with Fargate**: AWS manages them.

## Why Choose Which?

- **EKS-D**: For flexibility and control, same Kubernetes as EKS.
- **EKS-A**: For on-premises setups with AWS support.
- **EKS with EC2**: For managed control plane but custom worker nodes.
- **EKS with Fargate**: For a fully managed, serverless experience.
