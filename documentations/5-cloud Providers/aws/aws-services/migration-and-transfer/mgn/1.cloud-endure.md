## **üåç What AWS Did with CloudEndure**

### **Acquisition by AWS:**

- AWS acquired **CloudEndure** in 2019 to strengthen its cloud migration and disaster recovery services.
- CloudEndure‚Äôs capabilities were integrated into AWS offerings to simplify migrations and enhance disaster recovery solutions.

### **AWS Migration Hub Integration:**

- CloudEndure became a key component of **AWS Migration Hub**, offering end-to-end visibility for migration projects.
- Organizations can track and manage migrations centrally using Migration Hub.

### **AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN):**

- In 2021, AWS **rebranded and enhanced CloudEndure Migration** as part of the **AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)**.
- AWS MGN now offers similar functionality, such as automated migration and real-time replication, while being fully integrated into the AWS ecosystem.

üí° **Key Takeaway:**  
CloudEndure Migration evolved into AWS Application Migration Service (MGN), providing a free, fully managed migration tool for seamless transitions to AWS.
