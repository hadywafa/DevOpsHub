## üîç **What is API Gateway?**

**Amazon API Gateway** is a fully managed service that facilitates the creation, deployment, and management of APIs. It acts as a front door for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.

### üìå **Key Features:**

- **Fully Managed Service:** Handles the heavy lifting of API management, including scaling, monitoring, and security.
- **Supports Multiple API Types:** REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs.
- **Backend Integration:** Connects to various backend endpoints like EC2/ECS instances, Lambda functions, public/private HTTP endpoints, and AWS services (e.g., Kinesis, SQS, DynamoDB).
- **Secure HTTPS Endpoints:** Exposes secure HTTPS endpoints to users.
- **Caching:** Speeds up responses and reduces backend load with API caching.
- **Monitoring:** Logs API calls, latency, and error rates to AWS CloudWatch in near real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Creating and Managing APIs**

APIs can be created and managed using multiple methods:

1. **AWS Management Console:** User-friendly graphical interface.
2. **CLI:** Command-line interface for scripting and automation.
3. **SDKs:** Programmatic access using AWS SDKs.
4. **AWS CloudFormation:** Infrastructure as Code for automated deployments.
5. **OpenAPI Extensions:** Utilize API Gateway extensions to OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) for defining APIs.

## üìö **Supported API Types**

### 1. **RESTful APIs**

#### a. **REST APIs**

- **Features:** API proxy functionality, usage plans, API Keys, publishing, and monetizing APIs.

#### b. **HTTP APIs**

- **Optimized For:** APIs that proxy to Lambda and publicly routable HTTP endpoints.
- **Advantages:** Lower cost and lower latency compared to REST APIs.

### 2. **WebSocket APIs**

- **Purpose:** Maintain persistent, full-duplex connections for real-time, stateful communications (e.g., streaming).

## üîß **Endpoint Types**

### 1. **Edge Optimized Endpoint**

![Edge Optimized Endpoint](images/edge-optimized-endpoint.png)

- **Functionality:** Fronted by CloudFront by default.
- **Use Case:** Serve public APIs to geographically diverse (global) clients with low latency.
- **Security:** Integrate CloudFront security features like DDoS protection and AWS WAF.
- **Deployment:** Deployed in a single region but accessible globally through CloudFront edge locations.

### 2. **Regional API Endpoint**

![Regional API Endpoint](images/regional-api-endpoint.png)

- **Functionality:** Serves API requests within the same AWS region.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for APIs targeted at regional client bases.
- **Routing:** Use Route 53 latency routing to deploy across multiple regions with the same custom domain.
- **Optional Security:** Protect public APIs using an additional CloudFront distribution.

### 3. **Private API Endpoint**

![Private API Endpoint](images/private-api-endpoint.png)

- **Functionality:** Serves APIs privately within a VPC using API Gateway VPC interface endpoints.
- **Use Case:** Secure APIs for internal applications without exposing them to the internet.
- **Access:** Accessible by workloads on EC2, ECS (Fargate), and on-premises clients via Direct Connect.
- **Security:** Control access using Interface endpoint resource policies.
