## üåü **Key Features**

### 1. **Real-Time Search and Analytics**

- Enables near real-time searching and analytics for a variety of data types, such as:
  - Application logs.
  - Infrastructure metrics.
  - Clickstream data.
  - Security events.

### 2. **Integrated Analytics and Visualization**

- **OpenSearch Dashboards**:
  - A visualization and analytics tool for creating interactive dashboards and charts from your data.

### 3. **Broad Integration with AWS Services**

- Direct integration with:

  - **Kinesis Data Firehose**
  - **CloudWatch Logs**
  - **AWS IoT**
  - **Amazon S3**
  - **DynamoDB**

- Use **AWS Lambda** for custom data loading into OpenSearch from sources like **S3**, **DynamoDB**, and **Kinesis Data Streams**.

### 4. **Flexible Querying**

- Multiple search options:
  - URI searches (query strings).
  - Request body searches (JSON format).
  - **Dashboard Query Language (DQL)** for structured searches.
  - SQL queries for familiar database-like querying.
  - **Asynchronous Search**: Processes queries in the background for large datasets.

## üîê **Security and Compliance**

- **Data Encryption**:

  - **At Rest**: Using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
  - **In Transit**: Encrypted connections with TLS.

- **Access Control**:

  - **IAM Policies**: Fine-grained access control for users and roles.
  - **Cognito Integration**: Authentication for OpenSearch Dashboards.

- **VPC Integration**:

  - Supports VPC endpoints for secure communication.
  - Use security groups to control traffic to your OpenSearch clusters.

- **Alerting**:
  - Integrates with **SNS** to send notifications for custom alerts.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How OpenSearch Works**

1. **Data Ingestion**:

   - Stream data directly from **Kinesis**, **CloudWatch Logs**, or **IoT**.
   - Use **Lambda** for custom ingestion workflows.

2. **Data Indexing**:

   - Data is stored as searchable **documents**.
   - Indexed data is distributed across the cluster for scalability.

3. **Data Querying and Analytics**:
   - Use **DQL** or **SQL** to query and analyze data.
   - Visualize results in **OpenSearch Dashboards**.
