# **Resource-Based Policies in AWS** ðŸ”’

Resource-based policies are policies that are directly attached to AWS resources, rather than being assigned to IAM identities such as users, groups, or roles. These policies define **who** (the principal) can access the resource and what actions they can perform on it.

## Key Features of Resource-Based Policies:

- **Attach to Resources**: They are applied to specific AWS resources like S3 buckets, Lambda functions, SQS queues, etc.
- **Principal Element**: The `Principal` element identifies the AWS identities (users, roles, services) that are allowed or denied access to the resource.
- **Cross-Account Access**: Resource-based policies allow sharing of resources across different AWS accounts.
- **Inline Policies**: Resource policies are inline (not managed) policies, meaning they exist only on the resource they are attached to.

## Example of a Resource-Based Policy

Hereâ€™s an example of an S3 bucket policy that allows a specific IAM user (`bob`) from a different AWS account to upload objects to the `example-bucket`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::777788889999:user/bob" },
    "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:PutObjectAcl"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
  }
}
```

## **IAM Resource-Based Policies vs. IAM Roles for Cross-Account Access** ðŸ”„

### **Difference between Resource-Based Policies and IAM Roles**

- **Resource-Based Policies**: A resource-based policy directly allows or denies actions on a resource (e.g., an S3 bucket or SQS queue) for specific principals (such as users, roles, or services). The principal does not need to give up its permissions when accessing the resource, as the policy is directly tied to the resource itself.

- **IAM Roles for Cross-Account Access**: When using IAM roles for cross-account access, the principal temporarily assumes the permissions granted by the IAM role, meaning it "gives up" its original permissions to inherit those of the role.

### **When to Use Resource-Based Policies**

Resource-based policies are ideal when you want to share a resource across different accounts without needing to reassign the principalâ€™s permissions. For example, you might want to allow a user in another AWS account to upload objects to your S3 bucket.

## **Conclusion** ðŸŒŸ

Resource-Based Policies are essential for controlling access to AWS resources, especially for cross-account scenarios or when a resource needs to share access across different identities. By using these policies, you can ensure secure and granular access control without the need for IAM role assumptions. Additionally, **Permissions Boundaries** and the **IAM Policy Evaluation Logic** provide advanced control over what permissions are granted, ensuring your AWS environment is both flexible and secure.
