# **IAM Permissions Boundary** 🔐

## **What is a Permissions Boundary?**

A **Permissions Boundary** is an advanced feature in IAM that defines the maximum permissions that can be granted to a user or a role. It is a policy that sets an upper limit on the permissions a user or role can obtain from their identity-based policies.

- **Doesn't Grant Permissions**: Permissions boundaries **do not grant** permissions themselves. Instead, they limit the permissions that can be granted by the identity-based policy.
- **Intersection of Permissions**: The effective permissions for an IAM entity are determined by the intersection of the identity-based policy and the permissions boundary.

## **Use Cases for Permissions Boundaries**:

- **Delegating Permissions Management**: For example, you can delegate the ability to create roles or assign permissions to trusted employees, but restrict the level of permissions they can assign.
- **Controlling Maximum Permissions**: Prevent users from being granted excessive permissions, especially in production environments.

### Example of Using Permissions Boundaries in IAM Policies:

```json
"StringEquals": {
  "iam:PermissionsBoundary": "arn:aws:iam::AccountID:policy/PermBoundaryName"
}
```
