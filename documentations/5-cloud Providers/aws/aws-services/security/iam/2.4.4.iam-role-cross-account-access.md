# iam-role Cross-Account üè¶

IAM roles are commonly used for **cross-account access**, allowing resources from one AWS account (Account A) to be accessed by resources in another AWS account (Account B). This is useful when multiple AWS accounts need to interact with each other.

---

## **How Cross-Account Access Works üîó**

1. **Trusting Account (Account A)**:

   - The IAM role in **Account A** defines which entities are allowed to assume the role.

2. **Trusted Account (Account B)**:
   - The IAM user or resource in **Account B** must have the necessary permission to **assume the role** in Account A.

## **Example of Cross-Account Access**

![iam-role-ex-cross-account-access](images/iam-role-ex-cross-account-access.png)

Let's say **Account A** wants to grant **Account B** access to its S3 bucket (`s3bucket123`).

**1. Trust Policy- (Account A) :**

- This is a trust policy that will be used to create the iam role
- it is defines that **Account B** is allowed to assume the role in **Account A**.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AccountB-ID:root" },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
  }
}
```

**2. Permissions Policy (for IAM Role) - (Account A) :**

- This is permission policy that will give the power for the iam role to list the **s3bucket123**.
- it is defines the permissions granted when **Account B** assumes the role. Here, **Account B** is allowed to list the contents of the `s3bucket123`.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::s3bucket123"
  }
}
```

**3. Permission Policy (for iam user)- (Account B) :**

- This permission policy allows **Account B's** IAM user to wear (assume) the role in **Account A**.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::AccountA-ID:role/ls3bucket"
  }
}
```

## **Using External ID in Cross-Account Access üîê**

Imagine that you have two AWS accounts:

- **Account A**: A company that owns resources (e.g., S3 buckets, EC2 instances) and wants to allow access to those resources by a trusted third party.
- **Account B**: A third-party service provider that needs access to **Account A's** resources (e.g., accessing the S3 bucket to store logs).

Without any safeguards in place (like an **External ID**), Account A could inadvertently give **Account B** too much access, or allow a malicious third party to misuse the permissions. This is known as the **Confused Deputy Problem**.

### **Scenario: Without External ID (The Confused Deputy Problem)**

1. **Account A** creates a role and trusts **Account B** to assume that role.
2. **Account A** allows **Account B** to access its resources, like an S3 bucket, through a trust policy (e.g., **sts:AssumeRole**).
3. **Account B** has access to assume the role in **Account A**. However, **Account B** might not be the only party that can assume the role.
4. A malicious user from **Account C** can use **Account B‚Äôs** identity or service to assume **Account A's** role without **Account A** knowing. This happens because the role does not validate if **Account C** is the one attempting to assume the role, allowing **Account C** to take advantage of **Account B‚Äôs** permissions.

### **The Problem:**

- **Account A** intended to grant access to **Account B**, but **Account C** (a malicious third party) could also use **Account B's** role to gain unauthorized access to **Account A's** resources.
- **Account A** has no way of verifying that **Account C** is not pretending to be **Account B**.

This is the **Confused Deputy Problem**‚Äîwhere the deputy (Account B) gets "confused" by an external party (Account C) and grants access unintentionally.

### **How External ID Solves the Problem:**

The **External ID** is an added security feature to prevent this kind of confusion. It‚Äôs like a secret password that ensures that only the right party (**Account B**) can access **Account A‚Äôs** resources, and **Account C** cannot misuse the permissions.

### **Solution with External ID:**

1. **Account A** creates a role and specifies a trust policy that requires **Account B** to provide a specific **External ID** when assuming the role.
2. **Account B** knows the **External ID** and uses it when making a request to assume the role.
3. **Account C**, even though it might know the role ARN of **Account A**, **cannot assume the role** because it doesn‚Äôt know the **External ID**.
4. **Account A** is now confident that only **Account B** (with the correct **External ID**) can assume the role and access its resources.

### **Example:**

#### **Account A - Trust Policy with External ID**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AccountB-ID:root" },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "sts:ExternalId": "secret123"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Account B - User Policy to Assume the Role**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::AccountA-ID:role/MyRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "sts:ExternalId": "secret123"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this case:

- **Account B** can assume the role **only if** it includes the correct **External ID** ("secret123").
- **Account C**, even if it knows the role ARN, cannot assume the role because it does not have the correct **External ID**.

### **The Benefit of Using External ID:**

- **Prevents unauthorized access** by ensuring that only the **intended entity** (Account B) can assume the role.
- It **secures cross-account access** by verifying that the entity requesting access is indeed the trusted one (Account B), not a potential attacker (Account C).
- Protects against **malicious third parties** who might try to exploit roles across accounts.
