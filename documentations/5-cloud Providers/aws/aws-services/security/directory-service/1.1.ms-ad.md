# **MS Active Directory 🖥️**

Microsoft Active Directory (AD) is a **directory service** developed by Microsoft for **Windows domain networks**. It provides centralized **authentication, authorization, and resource management** for enterprises.

Understanding Active Directory is critical for managing **users, computers, and security policies** efficiently, whether **on-premises or in the cloud** (e.g., AWS, Azure).

---

## 🌟 **What is Active Directory (AD)?**

Active Directory is a **hierarchical directory service** that enables IT administrators to:

- **Authenticate and authorize users and devices** in a network.
- **Manage and organize IT resources** (users, computers, printers, applications).
- **Enforce security policies** and **centralize identity management**.

---

## 🔑 **Key Features**

- **Centralized User Management** – Controls access to network resources.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** – Users log in once to access multiple services.
- **Group Policy Management** – Enforce security settings across all devices.
- **Scalability** – Supports **large enterprises** with multiple domains and forests.
- **Integration with Cloud** – Works with **Azure AD, AWS AD** for hybrid environments.

## 🛠️ **Core Components of Active Directory**

### **1️⃣ Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**

💡 The **core directory service** that stores user accounts, groups, computers, and security policies.

### **2️⃣ Domain Controllers (DCs)**

💡 Servers that **authenticate users, enforce security policies**, and synchronize directory data.

### **3️⃣ Organizational Units (OUs)**

💡 Logical containers for organizing **users, groups, and computers** within a domain.

### **4️⃣ Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**

💡 Security settings and rules applied to **users and computers** across the organization.

### **5️⃣ Active Directory Schema**

💡 Defines the **structure and attributes** of objects stored in AD.

### **6️⃣ Global Catalog (GC)**

💡 A **read-only index** that enables **fast searching of AD objects** across multiple domains.

## 🔑 **Authentication and Authorization in AD**

### **1️⃣ Authentication (Who Are You?)**

- Verifies a user’s identity via **username & password**.
- Uses **Kerberos (default) or NTLM (legacy)** for secure login.

### **2️⃣ Authorization (What Can You Access?)**

- Determines **what resources** a user can access.
- Permissions are controlled through **group memberships and security policies**.

## 🤔 **Use Cases of Active Directory**

✔ **Enterprise User Management** – Centralized authentication for employees.  
✔ **Secure Network Access** – Ensures **only authorized users** access critical resources.  
✔ **Hybrid Cloud Environments** – Integrates with **Azure AD & AWS Managed AD**.  
✔ **Regulatory Compliance** – Helps enforce **IT security policies** across an organization.
