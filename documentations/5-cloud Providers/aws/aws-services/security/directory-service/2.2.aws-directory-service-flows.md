    autonumber
    participant User as User (AWS WorkSpaces / EC2)
    participant AWSClient as AWS WorkSpaces / EC2 Instance
    participant AWSAD as AWS Managed Microsoft AD
    participant IAM as AWS IAM Role / Policy
    participant AWSResource as AWS EC2 / S3 / RDS

    Note over User: üîπ User logs into AWS WorkSpaces or EC2 using AD credentials

    User->>AWSClient: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enters Username & Password
    AWSClient->>AWSAD: 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sends Kerberos Authentication Request
    AWSAD->>AWSClient: 3Ô∏è‚É£ Issues Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)

    Note over AWSClient: ‚úÖ User is successfully authenticated

    User->>AWSResource: 4Ô∏è‚É£ Requests Access to AWS Service (S3, EC2, RDS)
    AWSResource->>AWSAD: 5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate AD Group Membership & Policies
    AWSAD->>AWSResource: 6Ô∏è‚É£ Returns Group Membership Info
    AWSResource->>IAM: 7Ô∏è‚É£ Check IAM Role & AD Group Permissions
    IAM->>AWSResource: 8Ô∏è‚É£ Validate Permissions

    alt User has required permissions
        AWSResource->>User: 9Ô∏è‚É£ Access Granted ‚úÖ
    else User lacks permissions
        AWSResource->>User: ‚ùå Access Denied
    end
```

‚úÖ **Best for:** Large enterprises **running full Microsoft AD on AWS**.  
‚úÖ **Supports:** **Kerberos Authentication, Group Policies, Trust Relationships, Multi-AZ Deployment**.  
‚úÖ **Example:** Using **AWS AD for Amazon WorkSpaces and RDS authentication**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ AWS AD Connector - Detailed Sequence Flow**

**üí° AWS AD Connector acts as a proxy for on-premises AD.**

- **No AD data is replicated to AWS** ‚Äì authentication happens **directly with on-prem AD**.
- Used for **AWS IAM integration and Single Sign-On (SSO)**.
- **No need to deploy additional domain controllers in AWS**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant User as User (On-Prem or AWS)
    participant AWSClient as AWS WorkSpaces / EC2 Instance
    participant ADConnector as AWS AD Connector (Proxy)
    participant OnPremAD as On-Premises Active Directory
    participant IAM as AWS IAM Role / Policy
    participant AWSResource as AWS EC2 / S3 / RDS

    Note over User: üîπ User logs into AWS WorkSpaces or EC2 using on-prem AD credentials

    User->>AWSClient: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enters Username & Password
    AWSClient->>ADConnector: 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sends Authentication Request (LDAP/Kerberos)
    ADConnector->>OnPremAD: 3Ô∏è‚É£ Forwards Authentication Request
    OnPremAD->>ADConnector: 4Ô∏è‚É£ Validates Credentials & Returns Response
    ADConnector->>ADConnector: 5Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication Success or Failure

    alt Authentication Successful
        AWSClient->>AWSResource: 6Ô∏è‚É£ Requests Access to AWS Service (EC2, RDS, S3)
        AWSResource->>ADConnector: 7Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Group Membership & Policies
        ADConnector->>OnPremAD: 8Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve User Groups
        OnPremAD->>ADConnector: 9Ô∏è‚É£ Returns Group Membership Info
        ADConnector->>AWSResource: üîü Validate Group Permissions
        AWSResource->>IAM: 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Check IAM Role & AD Group Membership
        IAM->>AWSResource: 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Validate Permissions

        alt User has required permissions
            AWSResource->>User: 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Access Granted ‚úÖ
        else User lacks permissions
            AWSResource->>User: ‚ùå Access Denied
        end
    else Authentication Failed
        ADConnector->>User: ‚ùå Access Denied (Invalid Credentials)
    end
```

‚úÖ **Best for:** Companies **already using on-prem AD** and needing AWS authentication.  
‚úÖ **Supports:** **AWS SSO, IAM Role-based Access, AWS WorkSpaces, and RDS Authentication**.  
‚úÖ **Example:** Using **on-prem AD credentials to log into AWS services without replicating AD data to AWS**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Simple AD - Detailed Sequence Flow**

**üí° AWS Simple AD is a lightweight directory service based on Samba 4.**

- **Does not support Group Policies or Trust Relationships**.
- Works with **basic LDAP authentication** (not full AD features).
- **Ideal for Linux-based applications** needing LDAP authentication.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant User as User (AWS or Linux Client)
    participant AWSClient as EC2 / Linux Workstation
    participant SimpleAD as AWS Simple AD (Samba 4)
    participant AWSResource as AWS EC2 / RDS / Application

    Note over User: üîπ User logs into AWS Linux system

    User->>AWSClient: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enter LDAP Credentials
    AWSClient->>SimpleAD: 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sends LDAP Authentication Request
    SimpleAD->>AWSClient: 3Ô∏è‚É£ Validate Credentials & Return Authentication Response

    alt Authentication Successful
        AWSClient->>AWSResource: 4Ô∏è‚É£ Request Access to AWS Application
        AWSResource->>SimpleAD: 5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate User Permissions

        alt User has required permissions
            AWSResource->>User: 6Ô∏è‚É£ Access Granted ‚úÖ
        else User lacks permissions
            AWSResource->>User: ‚ùå Access Denied
        end
    else Authentication Failed
        SimpleAD->>User: ‚ùå Access Denied (Invalid Credentials)
    end
```

‚úÖ **Best for:** Small businesses needing **basic LDAP authentication** for applications.  
‚úÖ **Supports:** **Samba 4, LDAP-based authentication** (No Group Policies or Trusts).  
‚úÖ **Example:** Using **Simple AD to authenticate users for a Linux-based application in AWS**.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Choosing the Right AWS Directory Service**

| **AWS Directory Service**    | **Best For**                                       | **Supports**                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Managed Microsoft AD** | Full **Microsoft Active Directory** in AWS         | **Group Policies, Kerberos, LDAP, Trust Relationships** |
| **AWS AD Connector**         | Using **on-prem AD credentials in AWS**            | **AWS SSO, IAM Role Mapping, No AD replication**        |
| **Simple AD**                | Basic **LDAP authentication** for small businesses | **Samba 4, No Group Policies or Trusts**                |

---

## ‚úÖ **Final Thoughts**

AWS Directory Service **simplifies Active Directory and LDAP management in AWS**.

- **AWS Managed Microsoft AD** = **Full AD in AWS** for enterprises.
- **AWS AD Connector** = **Extend on-prem AD** to AWS without replication.
- **Simple AD** = **Basic LDAP authentication** for small workloads.

üí° **Choosing the right AWS Directory Service depends on your authentication and access control needs.** üöÄ
