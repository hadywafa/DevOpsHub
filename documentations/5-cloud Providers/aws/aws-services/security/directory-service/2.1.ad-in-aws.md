# üè¢ **Active Directory in AWS**

AWS offers several options for integrating and managing Active Directory in the cloud:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed MS AD)**

A fully managed Active Directory service in AWS that:

- Mirrors on-premises AD capabilities.
- Enables **single sign-on (SSO)** to AWS resources.
- Can establish **trust relationships** with on-premises AD for hybrid setups.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **AD Connector**

A lightweight proxy service that:

- Connects AWS resources to an existing **on-premises AD**.
- Does not replicate the AD database to AWS.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Simple AD**

A low-cost, lightweight directory option for basic AD compatibility:

- Ideal for LDAP-aware applications.
- Does not support advanced AD features like trust relationships.

## üåç **How Active Directory Works with AWS Services**

1. **Amazon RDS for SQL Server**

   - Integrates with AD for database authentication using Windows credentials.

2. **Amazon WorkSpaces**

   - Provides managed virtual desktops that users can log into using AD credentials.

3. **AWS SSO and Cognito**

   - Uses AD for **user authentication** in AWS Single Sign-On (SSO).
   - Can federate AD users into AWS Cognito for SaaS application access.

4. **Hybrid Scenarios**
   - Trust relationships between on-premises AD and AWS Managed AD enable hybrid cloud setups.
