## üåê What is AWS Shield?

AWS Shield is a service that helps protect your applications on AWS from DDoS attacks. Think of it as a security guard for your online services.

## üö® What is a DDoS Attack?

A **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack** is when bad actors try to overwhelm your server with too much traffic, making it hard or impossible for real users to access your site or service. It's like a traffic jam on the internet!

- **Multiple Sources:** Attackers use many computers (botnets) to send fake traffic to your server.
- **Traffic Flood:** This fake traffic overwhelms the server, causing slowdowns or crashes.
- **Resource Overload:** Your server can't handle the massive surge in traffic and struggles to stay online.
