## üõ† **CloudHSM Cryptographic Capabilities**

AWS CloudHSM supports a variety of cryptographic tasks:

- **Encryption/Decryption**: For securing sensitive data.
- **Digital Signatures**: Signing data and verifying signatures.
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Calculating message digests for data integrity.
- **Key Management**: Generating, importing, exporting, and managing keys.

## üîó **Integration with AWS KMS Custom Key Store**

AWS CloudHSM integrates with AWS KMS through the **KMS Custom Key Store** feature:

- **Custom Key Store** allows KMS to generate and store encryption keys in a CloudHSM cluster.
- Ensures server-side encryption for AWS services such as **S3**, **EBS**, and **RDS**.
- Key operations remain inside the CloudHSM for maximum security.

## üîÑ **High Availability and Redundancy**

AWS CloudHSM ensures high availability through clustering:

- Clusters consist of one or more CloudHSM devices running in a VPC.
- Nodes can be deployed across multiple Availability Zones.
- Backups occur daily and can be copied to other regions for creating cluster clones.
