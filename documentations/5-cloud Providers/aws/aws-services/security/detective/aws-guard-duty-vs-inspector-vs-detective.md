# Amazon Detective, AWS GuardDuty, and AWS Inspector: Comparison

1. **Amazon Detective**: Think of Detective as a **private investigator**. When something suspicious happens, Detective digs into all the logs and data, and creates a visual map to help you understand what happened, why it happened, and how. It's all about investigating and visualizing the incident.

2. **AWS GuardDuty**: GuardDuty acts like a **security guard**. It constantly watches over your AWS environment, looking for threats like unauthorized access, compromised accounts, or unusual activity. When it finds something suspicious, it alerts you with detailed findings and advice on how to fix the issue.

3. **AWS Inspector**: Inspector is like a **health inspector** for your AWS resources. It regularly checks your servers and applications for vulnerabilities (like outdated software or misconfigurations) and provides detailed reports on what needs to be fixed to improve security.

## Key Differences

- **Amazon Detective**: Investigates incidents and provides visual insights.
- **AWS GuardDuty**: Detects threats and alerts you.
- **AWS Inspector**: Scans for vulnerabilities and provides reports.
