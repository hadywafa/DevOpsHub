## üîó **What is Storage Gateway?**

**Amazon Storage Gateway** is a hybrid cloud storage service that enables your on-premises applications to seamlessly use AWS cloud storage. It `connects` your on-premises IT environment with AWS storage services like Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Glacier (object-based), and Amazon FSx (file-based) for file and/or block storage.

### **Deployment Options:**

1. **Virtual Machine (VM):**

   - **Installation:** Download from AWS and install in your virtualized environment on-premises (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, or KVM).

2. **Physical Appliance:**
   - **Preinstalled:** Comes with Storage Gateway preinstalled.
   - **Interfaces:** Exposes SMB, NFS, or iSCSI interfaces based on the gateway configuration.
   - **Security:** Utilizes HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) for data at rest in S3.
   - **Efficiency:** Transfers only changed data and employs data compression to optimize performance.
