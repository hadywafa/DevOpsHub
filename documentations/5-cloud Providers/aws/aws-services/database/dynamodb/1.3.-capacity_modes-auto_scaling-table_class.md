# ⚙️ Capacity Modes, Auto Scaling & Table Classes in DynamoDB

## 📊 Capacity Modes

DynamoDB has two capacity modes to choose from based on your needs:

### 1. Provisioned R/W Capacity Mode

- **What It Is:** You decide how much read and write capacity your table needs.
- **Cost:** You pay for the amount of capacity you set, even if you don't use it all.
- **When to Use:** Best for when you know your traffic patterns.
- **Auto Scaling:** You can use auto scaling with this mode to adjust capacity based on demand.

### 2. On-Demand R/W Capacity Mode

- **What It Is:** DynamoDB automatically scales capacity based on traffic, so you don't need to set read and write capacity.
- **Cost:** You pay based on the actual number of requests made to the table. This is more expensive than provisioned mode but more flexible.
- **When to Use:** Ideal for unpredictable workloads or when you don't want to manage capacity settings.

## ⚙️ Auto Scaling

**Auto Scaling** helps adjust the read and write capacity of your DynamoDB table based on demand:

- **How It Works:** Uses CloudWatch and application auto scaling to adjust capacity up or down as needed.
- **Configuration:** You set a scaling policy with a starting RCU/WCU and a target utilization percentage.
- **Use Cases:** Great for applications with varying traffic like social media or gaming.
- **Default Setting:** Auto scaling is enabled by default on provisioned capacity tables but can be customized.

## 🗂️ Table Classes

DynamoDB offers two table classes to help optimize costs:

1. **DynamoDB Standard (default):**

   - **Best For:** Most workloads.

2. **DynamoDB Standard-Infrequent Access (IA):**
   - **Best For:** Tables that store data accessed infrequently.
   - **Examples:** Application logs, old social media posts, e-commerce order history.
   - **Cost:** WCUs and RCUs are more expensive, but storage costs are less than half of the standard class.

> **Tip:** Choose the table class based on how often you access data and your storage needs to optimize costs.
