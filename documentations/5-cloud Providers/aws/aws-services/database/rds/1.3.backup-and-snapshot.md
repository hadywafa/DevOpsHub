# **RDS Backup and Snapshot ðŸ“‚**

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) offers several features for backing up and restoring your database instances. These include **automated backups**, **manual snapshots**, and the ability to **copy/share snapshots** across regions or accounts. Here's an overview of RDS backup and snapshot features, explaining how they work, how to use them, and the best practices.

## **1. Automated Backups ðŸ”„**

### **What Are Automated Backups?**

Automated backups are point-in-time copies of your entire RDS database (DB) that are taken daily by AWS. These backups are enabled by default and provide an easy way to restore your DB to a specific point in time.

#### **Key Features:**

- **First Backup**: A full snapshot of your DB.
- **Incremental Backups**: After the first backup, subsequent backups are incremental, meaning only changes since the last backup are stored.
- **Transaction Logs**: RDS also backs up your transaction logs every 5 minutes, allowing for granular restoration.
- **Storage**: The backups are stored in Amazon S3.
- **Retention**: Automated backups are kept for a retention period, which can be configured (by default, up to 35 days).

#### **Backup Process:**

- **S3 Storage**: Automated backups are stored securely in Amazon S3.
- **Point-in-time Restoration**: You can restore your DB to any point within the retention period, with a granularity of up to five minutes using the transaction logs.

#### **Costs:**

- There are **no additional charges** for automated backups, except for the storage consumed by the backup data.

### **Automated Snapshot**

- **Snapshot Retention**: By default, snapshots are retained for seven days (can be configured to retain between 0 and 35 days).
- **Multi-AZ Deployments**: In multi-AZ deployments, backups are taken from the standby instance to ensure minimal impact during backup.
- **Export to S3**: Automated backups can be exported to a customer's S3 bucket for long-term storage.

### **Restoring from Automated Backup ðŸ”„**

Automated backups can be restored to any point in time during the retention period of the snapshot. Hereâ€™s how the process works:

- **Point-in-Time Restore**: Using transaction logs, AWS can restore your DB to the exact second, up to five minutes prior to the point you request.
- **DB Storage Type Change**: You can also choose to change the DB storage type during the restore process, allowing flexibility in scaling your DB's storage performance.

## **2. Manual Snapshots ðŸ“¸**

### **What Are Manual Snapshots?**

Manual snapshots are snapshots that are created by the user, providing a snapshot of the DB instance at a specific point in time.

#### **Key Features:**

- **Manual Creation**: Snapshots are created manually by you whenever needed, such as before making significant changes or deleting a DB instance.
- **Persistence**: Unlike automated backups, **manual snapshots are not deleted automatically** when the DB instance is deleted.
- **Restore Limitations**: Manual snapshots cannot be restored to a specific point in time but can only be restored to the exact state when the snapshot was taken.

#### **Best Practices:**

- AWS recommends taking a final manual snapshot of your DB before deleting it to preserve its current state.

## **3. Copying and Sharing Database Snapshots ðŸ”„**

You can copy and share both **automated backups** and **manual snapshots** within the same region or across different AWS regions.

### **Copying Snapshots:**

- **Copying Within the Same Region**: Snapshots can be copied to another snapshot within the same region.
- **Cross-Region Copying**: You can also copy snapshots to a different AWS region for disaster recovery or migration purposes.

### **Sharing Snapshots:**

- **Manual Snapshots**: Manual snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts, enabling you to collaborate with other teams or customers.
  - **Encrypted Snapshots**: You can also share encrypted snapshots with other accounts, though the recipient must have the correct permissions to decrypt the snapshot.
- **Automated Backups**: These cannot be directly shared with other accounts. However, you can copy the automated backup into a manual snapshot and then share it.

## **Summary ðŸ“Š**

- **Automated Backups**: Point-in-time backups with daily full backups and 5-minute transaction log backups. Stored in S3 and free of additional charges.
- **Manual Snapshots**: User-triggered snapshots that are persistent, but cannot be restored to a specific point in time.
- **Copying and Sharing**: Snapshots can be copied within regions or across regions, and manual snapshots can be shared with other accounts for collaboration.

RDS provides a flexible and reliable way to back up your database instances, ensuring that your data is secure and recoverable when needed. Whether using automated backups for easy, scheduled backups or manual snapshots for custom backups, you have the tools to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.
