# **Amazon RDS ‚Äì Cross Region Automated Backups üåç**

Amazon RDS allows you to configure your RDS database to replicate automated backups and transaction logs to a different AWS region, providing enhanced disaster recovery capabilities.

- **Supported Engines**: This feature is available for **Oracle**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MS SQL** databases.
- **Automated Cross-Region Replication**: RDS automatically initiates the cross-region copy of all **snapshots** and **transaction logs** to a destination region. This ensures that your backup data is safely replicated across AWS regions.
- **Data Transfer Costs**: There are charges for copying DB snapshots across regions, and the data transfer is billed accordingly.
- **Storage Charges**: After the snapshot is copied to the destination region, standard storage charges apply in that region.

## **Benefits**

- **Disaster Recovery**: Provides an additional layer of protection by replicating data to a geographically distant region, helping to safeguard against region-wide failures.
- **High Availability**: Facilitates quicker restoration of databases in another region in the event of a disaster or failure.
