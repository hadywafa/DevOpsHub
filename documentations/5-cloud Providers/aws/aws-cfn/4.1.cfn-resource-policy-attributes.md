# **CloudFormation Resource Policy Attributes**

In AWS CloudFormation, **resource policy attributes** play a critical role in controlling the behavior of specific resources during the stack creation, update, replacement, or deletion process. These attributes allow you to manage dependencies, signals, wait conditions, and lifecycle policies, ensuring the reliable deployment and management of your AWS resources.

---

## **Key Resource Policy Attributes**

The following are the main **resource policy attributes** in CloudFormation:

| Attribute                 | Purpose                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`CreationPolicy`**      | Ensures a resource is marked as complete only after a condition (e.g., a signal) is met.               |
| **`UpdatePolicy`**        | Controls how CloudFormation handles updates for certain resources, such as Auto Scaling groups.        |
| **`DeletionPolicy`**      | Determines the behavior of a resource when the stack is deleted (e.g., retain or delete the resource). |
| **`UpdateReplacePolicy`** | Defines what happens to a resource when it is replaced during a stack update.                          |

---

## **1️⃣ CreationPolicy**

The **`CreationPolicy`** attribute is used to **wait for specific conditions or signals** before marking a resource as successfully created. This is particularly useful for resources like **EC2 instances** or **Auto Scaling groups**, where initialization tasks (e.g., installing software) must be completed before proceeding.

### **Syntax**

```yaml
Resources:
  LogicalResourceName:
    Type: ResourceType
    CreationPolicy:
      ResourceSignal:
        Count: Integer
        Timeout: String
```

- **`Count`**: The number of success signals required.
- **`Timeout`**: The maximum time to wait for the signals (e.g., `PT10M` for 10 minutes).

### **Example: CreationPolicy for an EC2 Instance**

```yaml
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Metadata:
      AWS::CloudFormation::Init:
        config:
          packages:
            yum:
              httpd: []
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      ImageId: ami-12345678
      UserData:
        Fn::Base64: !Sub |
          #!/bin/bash
          yum install -y httpd
          /usr/bin/cfn-signal --success true --stack ${AWS::StackName} --resource MyEC2Instance --region ${AWS::Region}
    CreationPolicy:
      ResourceSignal:
        Count: 1
        Timeout: PT5M
```

### **How It Works**

1. The EC2 instance starts and runs the script defined in `UserData`.
2. The instance sends a success signal using **`cfn-signal`**.
3. CloudFormation waits for 1 signal (defined in `Count`) before marking the resource as successfully created.
4. If the timeout is exceeded without receiving the signal, the stack fails.

## **2️⃣ UpdatePolicy**

The **`UpdatePolicy`** attribute is specific to certain resource types, such as **Auto Scaling groups** or **Amazon ElastiCache replication groups**. It defines how CloudFormation should handle **updates** to these resources during stack updates.

### **Supported Update Policies**

| Policy                            | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`AutoScalingReplacingUpdate`**  | Controls whether instances are replaced during updates to an Auto Scaling group.                |
| **`AutoScalingRollingUpdate`**    | Defines how rolling updates are applied to an Auto Scaling group (e.g., batch size, wait time). |
| **`CodeDeployLambdaAliasUpdate`** | Manages traffic shifting between Lambda function versions during an update.                     |
| **`EnableVersionUpgrade`**        | Specifies whether to upgrade a database engine during an update (e.g., Amazon ElastiCache).     |
| **`UseOnlineResharding`**         | Enables online resharding for ElastiCache clusters during an update.                            |

### **Example: UpdatePolicy for Auto Scaling**

```yaml
Resources:
  MyAutoScalingGroup:
    Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup
    UpdatePolicy:
      AutoScalingRollingUpdate:
        MinInstancesInService: 1
        MaxBatchSize: 2
        PauseTime: PT10M
```

### **How It Works**

- **`MinInstancesInService`**: Ensures at least 1 instance remains in service during the update.
- **`MaxBatchSize`**: Specifies the number of instances to update at a time.
- **`PauseTime`**: Adds a wait time between updates, allowing new instances to stabilize.

## **3️⃣ DeletionPolicy**

The **`DeletionPolicy`** attribute controls what happens to a resource when the stack is deleted. It is crucial for resources where you want to **preserve data** (e.g., S3 buckets or RDS databases).

### **Allowed Values**

| Value          | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Delete`**   | The resource is deleted when the stack is deleted (default).                                       |
| **`Retain`**   | The resource is kept, even after the stack is deleted.                                             |
| **`Snapshot`** | A snapshot of the resource is created before it is deleted (for resources that support snapshots). |

### **Example: DeletionPolicy for an RDS Database**

```yaml
Resources:
  MyDatabase:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
    Properties:
      DBInstanceClass: db.t2.micro
      Engine: MySQL
      MasterUsername: admin
      MasterUserPassword: password
    DeletionPolicy: Snapshot
```

### **How It Works**

- When the stack is deleted, a **snapshot** of the RDS database is created to preserve the data.
- This ensures data recovery even after the stack is removed.

---

## **4️⃣ UpdateReplacePolicy**

The **`UpdateReplacePolicy`** attribute defines what happens to a resource **when it is replaced** during a stack update. This is useful for resources like **S3 buckets, RDS instances, and EBS volumes**, where preserving data is important when making changes that require a resource replacement.

### **Allowed Values**

| Value          | Description                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Delete`**   | The resource is deleted when replaced (default behavior).                  |
| **`Retain`**   | The old resource is kept when replaced.                                    |
| **`Snapshot`** | A snapshot of the resource is created before it is deleted (if supported). |

### **Example: UpdateReplacePolicy for an S3 Bucket**

```yaml
Resources:
  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-important-bucket
    UpdateReplacePolicy: Retain
```

### **Example: UpdateReplacePolicy with DeletionPolicy for an RDS Database**

```yaml
Resources:
  MyDatabase:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
    Properties:
      DBInstanceClass: db.t3.micro
      Engine: PostgreSQL
      MasterUsername: admin
      MasterUserPassword: password
    UpdateReplacePolicy: Snapshot
    DeletionPolicy: Snapshot
```

### **How It Works**

- If the **RDS instance** needs to be replaced during an update, a **snapshot** is created before replacement.
- When the **stack is deleted**, a final snapshot is taken as well.

## **Comparison of Resource Policy Attributes**

| Attribute               | Purpose                             | Common Use Cases                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **CreationPolicy**      | Wait for resource readiness         | EC2 setup, Auto Scaling initialization       |
| **UpdatePolicy**        | Manage resource updates             | Auto Scaling rolling updates, Lambda aliases |
| **DeletionPolicy**      | Control resource behavior on delete | Retaining S3 buckets, creating RDS snapshots |
| **UpdateReplacePolicy** | Control behavior on replacement     | Preserving S3 buckets, snapshots for RDS     |

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Use `DeletionPolicy: Retain` for critical resources** (e.g., S3, RDS) to avoid accidental data loss.
2. **Set `UpdateReplacePolicy: Snapshot` for databases and EBS volumes** to preserve data in case of replacement.
3. **Combine `DeletionPolicy` and `UpdateReplacePolicy` for maximum data protection** in sensitive environments.
