CloudFront edge locations cost/GB varies by edge-location.

![CloudFront Price Classes](images/cloudFront-price-classes.png)

- CloudFront edge locations are grouped into geographic regions, and hence, price classes.
- By default, CloudFront responds to requests based on the least latency edge location near the user, Class All
- Class 100 (North America, Europe and Israel).
- Class 200 ( All except South America, Australia, and NZ).
- We can lower CloudFront costs by selecting a less expensive price class (instead of the default, Class All), We should expect higher latencies for regions that are not within the class.
- We can choose the price class when creating the distribution or after.
