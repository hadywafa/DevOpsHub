# CloudFront – Cache Configuration

## Cache Behavior

A cache behavior is the configuration of a CloudFront distribution that defines the path pattern, how requests are served, and from which origin server.

- We can configure multiple cache behaviors.
- One of the cache behaviors is the default that serves any path pattern that does not have a match in the list of cache behaviors.
- A path pattern (ex. Images/\*.jpg) within a cache behavior defines which requests this cache behavior servers.

## Cache Key

A `cache key` is a unique identifier for an object in the cache.

- Each object in the cache has a unique cache key.
- A cache hit occurs when a viewer request generates the same cache key as a prior request and the object is in the edge location’s cache and is valid.
- By default, the information used to generate the cache key is the CloudFront web distribution domain name and the path of the requested object.

## Cache Policy

- A CloudFront Cache Policy defines the configuration parameters like TTL, Information included in the cache key (Query Strings, HTTP headers, Cookies).

- CloudFront provides some managed (predefined) cache policies.

- A CloudFront Origin Request Policy controls the values (URL query strings, HTTPheaders, and Cookies) that are included in the requests that CloudFront sends to the origin to fetch an object that is not in the cache.
