# Object/File Invalidation

Invalidating files from CloudFront edge locations before they expire (CLI, API, Console).

```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id distribution_ID --paths "/*"
```

- We can use an object path/name or use \* as a wildcard to remove multiple objects.
- Examples:
  - /images/beach.jpg
  - /images/beac\*
  - /Images/\*
- Invalidations are chargeable (after 1000 free tier invalidations per month)
- The other way is to leave the unwanted Objects to expire in the CloudFront cache and rely on object versioning using different object names.
  - Is less expensive.
  - Allows rolling back and forth if required.
  - Can serve different versions to different uses
