# CloudFront GeoLocation Blocking (GeoRestriction)

For compliance or governance reasons, we can use `CloudFront Geo Restriction (Geo Blocking)` feature to restrict access to the content distributed by a CloudFront distribution to certain Goes/countries.

- The user location is found using the userâ€™s source IP address and a GeoIP database.
- The feature is configured at the CDN level; not at the object level.
- HTTP 403 (Forbidden) will be returned to the user when/if restricted.
- Alternatively, we can customize an error page.

**GeoBlocking configuration can be done in two ways:**

- **Whitelist:**  
  Users from a country will only be allowed access to the content if their country is on a whitelist of allowed countries.
- **Blacklist:**  
  Users from certain countries will be prevented from access to the content if their country is on a blacklist of restricted countries.
