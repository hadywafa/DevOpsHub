# EFS Storage Classes

## 1. Standard Class (Multi-AZ)

### **EFS Standard**

- Default storage class when a file is stored in Standard EFS.
- Used for frequently accessed files

### **EFS Standard-IA**

- Same features as EFS
- For data that is not accessed every day
- **Use cases:** include audit data, historical analysis data, backup and recovery.
- `Lesser storage cost`.
- `Per GB data retrieval fee`

## 2. One Zone Class (Single AZ)

### **EFS One Zone**

- Default storage class when data is written into this EFS class.
- Used for frequently accessed files within one zone

### **EFS One Zone-IA**

- Same features as EFS
- For data that is not accessed every day
- **Use cases:** include audit data, historical analysis data, backup and recovery.
- `Lesser storage cost`.
- `Per GB data retrieval fee`.

### One zone class Notes

- For added protection, AWS Automatically backs up file systems using One Zone storage class using AWS backup.
- EFS file system backups that are created and managed using AWS Backup are replicated to three Availability Zones.
- Backups can be used to restore a file system in a different AZ or in a different AWS region.

## 3. EFS Intelligent-Tiering

- EFS Intelligent-Tiering uses Lifecycle Management to automatically achieve the right price and performance blend for your application by moving your files between the Standard and Standard-Infrequent Access storage classes.
- It is achieved when both Transition Into IA and Transition Out of IA are enabled.
- Default is 30 days with no access moves the file into IA class.
- First access moves the file from the IA class into the Standard class.

## EFS Lifecycle Management

- When enabled, EFS lifecycle policies automatically move files between standard and Infrequent access classes
- If lifecycle policies are not enabled, files do not transition between Standard and IA classes, they will be stored and remain in Standard.
- We can enable, stop, or modify lifecycle policies on an existing EFS file system.

**There are two types of EFS lifecycle policies:**

1. `Transition into IA`

   - Transition files into IA class.
   - This type of lifecycle policy can be configured to transition files into IA class if not accessed for none, 7, 14, 30 (default), 60, or 90 days.

2. `Transition out of IA`

   - Transition files from IA class to Standard class.
   - This type of lifecycle policy can be configured to transition files from IA class into Standard on first access.
   - Options are None, on first access
