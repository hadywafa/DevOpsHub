# EFS Features

## **Data Encryption**

- EFS supports encryption in-transit.
- EFS encrypts data at rest at rest using KMS keys (default â€“ can be disabled)

## **Backup & Restore**

### **1. AWS Backup:**

- A comprehensive backup solution that simplifies backup creation, scheduling, restoration, deletion, and reporting.
- We can restore the EFS file system from these backups to the same or a new EFS file system.

### **2. EFS to EFS backup**

- Can be used to copy data between EFS file systems in the same or different AWS Regions.
- Use it only when AWS backup is not available in the intended region(s)

## **Performance Modes**

You can select the mode at file system creation time. It cannot be changed after that.

### **1. General Purpose (AWS Recommended):**

- Fits most use cases.
- Idea in latency sensitive use cases such as web serving, content management, home directories and general file serving.
- Up to 35,000 IOPS

### **2. Max I/O:**

- Can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput with slightly higher latencies for file operations.
- Suitable for highly parallelized applications and workloads such as big data, media processing and genomics analysis.
- 500,000+ IOPS

## **Throughput Modes**

You can switch between throughput modes (only once in any 24 hours period)

### **1. Bursting Mode:**

- Default & AWS Recommended for most use cases.
- EFS throughput scales as the file system size increases.
- The throughput is allowed to burst,
  - If burst credits exist, up to 100MBps per TB of data.
  - When no burst credits are available, up to 50MBps per TB.
- Use it if not sure which mode to choose

### **Enhanced Mode:**

#### **2. Provisioned Mode:**

- Use it for spiky or unpredictable workloads.
- EFS automatically scales the throughput up and down to meet the workload needs

#### **3. Elastic Mode:**

- Decide and instantly provision the throughput of the file system (in MiB/s) independent of the amount of file system data size.
- Use for applications with constant throughput

## **EFS Replication**

![EFS Replication](images/efs-replication.png)

- Amazon EFS replication is used to create a replica of an Amazon EFS file system in another AWS Region.
- When enabled, Amazon EFS automatically creates the destination (new) file system and replicates the data and metadata on the source file system to the new destination (read only) EFS file system.
- A replication configuration is used to manage the process of creating the destination file system and keeping it synced with the source file system.
- Amazon EFS replication is continual and designed to provide a recovery point objective (RPO) and a recovery time objective (RTO) of minutes.

## **File System Policy**

EFS File System Policy is a resource-based policy that can be
configured at the file system level to determine who can do
what (actions that are allowed on this file system)
