# FSx for lustre

## What is Lustre ?

Lustre (Linux Cluster) is an open source, POSIX compliant (Linux Clients only), object-based, distributed, parallel, clustered file system.

- Lustre is suitable for the most demanding data intensive applications, such as High-Performance Computing (HPC).
- Lustre is designed for massive scale.
- It provides the highest I/O performance.
- It provides sub-millisecond latencies.
- It provides 100s of Gbps throughput and millions of IOPS.
- It is a low cost, ultra-fast, storage

## What is FSx for Lustre ?

Amazon FSx for Lustre provides a fully managed Lustre file system for compute-intensive workloads that require high performance, low latency, scale-out and parallel file systems.

- It provides the highest I/O performance.
- It provides sub-millisecond latencies.
- It provides 100s of Gbps throughput and millions of IOPS.
- It is a low cost, ultra-fast, storage.
- Option for SSD and HDD storage.
- Can be accessed from EC2, ECS, and EKS instances.

**Use cases:**

- HPC.
- Machine Learning.
- Video processing/rendering.
- Big data and financial analytics.

## Access to File Systems

FSx for Lustre creates an ENI inside the VPC which is associated with a security group.

- FSx for Lustre encrypts data automatically before it is written to the file system using AWS KMS keys.
- Clients can be in AWS (same VPC, peered VPC) or on-premises.
- FSx for Lustre is for short term, compute intensive workloads.
- Long-term data, and computations results, need to be in a durable storage system (S3 or on-premises).
- FSx for Lustre is integrated with S3, KMS, CloudWatch and CloudTrail.

## Deployment Modes

### **1. Scratch file system (Single AZ):**

- Lowest in cost.
- Designed for short term processing and temporary data storage.
- Data is not persistent.
- Does not support file system backups.
- Does not support data replication.

### **2. Persistent file system (Single AZ):**

- Designed for longer term processing and storage.
- File servers are highly available.
- Data is replicated within the AZ, and data volumes are replicated.
- Supports file system daily automated backups

## Integration with S3

FSx for Lustre is natively integrated with S3.

- If the data to be processed is in S3,
  - FSx for Lustre transparently presents the S3 objects as files,
  - This means we can process the data in an S3 bucket without having to transfer the data into the Lustre file system
