# 🔒 **Amazon S3 Encryption**

Amazon S3 provides robust encryption mechanisms to ensure the security and privacy of your data both **in-transit** and **at-rest**. Understanding these encryption options is crucial for solution architects to design secure and compliant storage solutions. This guide explores the different encryption methods available in S3, their features, and best practices for implementation.

---

## 🔐 **Encryption Overview**

Encryption in Amazon S3 can be categorized into two primary types:

- **🔄 Encryption in-Transit:** Encrypting data as it moves between your applications and S3.
- **💾 Encryption at-Rest:** Encrypting data while it is stored in S3, which can be managed either by the client or by S3 itself.

---

## 🔄 **S3 Object Encryption In-Transit**

Ensuring data is encrypted during transmission is vital to protect it from interception or tampering.

</div>

### **Key Points:**

- **🌐 Endpoints:**

  - **HTTP and HTTPS:** S3 provides both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints for data transfer.

- **🔒 Enforcing Encryption:**

  - **Use HTTPS:** To encrypt data in transit, always use the **HTTPS** endpoint.
  - **Bucket Policy Enforcement:** You can enforce the use of HTTPS by configuring bucket policies to reject non-HTTPS requests.

- **🛡️ Client-Side Encryption:**
  - **Optional Encryption:** Objects do not need to be encrypted on the client side if server-side encryption is used.

---

## 💾 **S3 Object Encryption At-Rest**

Encrypting data at rest ensures that your data remains secure while stored in S3. This can be managed either by the client or by S3.

  <img src="images/encryption-at-rest-types.png" alt="Encryption At-Rest Types">
</div>

### **Encryption Methods:**

1. **🔑 Client-Side Encryption (CSE):**

   - **Description:** The client is responsible for encrypting and decrypting data before uploading to S3.
   - **Key Management:** S3 does not manage encryption keys; this responsibility lies entirely with the client.

2. **🔐 Server-Side Encryption (SSE):**
   - **Description:** S3 handles the encryption and decryption of data before storing it on disk.
   - **Key Management:** Depending on the SSE method chosen, key management can be handled by S3 or AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
   - **Encryption Scope:** Only the object data is encrypted; metadata remains unencrypted.

### 🗝️ **Client-Side Encryption At-Rest (CSE)**

<div align="center" style="padding: 0 20px;">
  <img src="images/cse.gif" alt="Client-Side Encryption (CSE)">
</div>

#### **How It Works:**

1. **🔑 Key Provision:** The client generates or provides an encryption key.

2. **🔄 Data Encryption:** The client encrypts the data using the provided key before uploading it to S3.

3. **🚀 Data Upload:** The encrypted data is uploaded to S3 via HTTPS, ensuring in-transit encryption.

4. **🔓 Data Retrieval:** When retrieving the data, the client downloads the encrypted object and decrypts it using the original key.

#### **Key Points:**

- **🔐 Full Control:** The client is responsible for encrypting and decrypting data, as well as managing encryption keys.
- **🔄 Encryption Process:** Each object is encrypted on the client side before being uploaded to S3.
- **🔒 In-Transit Encryption:** Objects are automatically encrypted in-transit when using HTTPS endpoints.

---

### 🛡️ **Server-Side Encryption At-Rest (SSE)**

Server-side encryption allows S3 to manage the encryption and decryption processes. There are three types of SSE:

- **SSE-S3**
- **SSE-KMS**
- **SSE-C**

---

#### 1. **🔒 SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys)**

<div align="center" style="padding: 0 20px;">
  <img src="images/sse-s3.gif" alt="SSE-S3">
</div>

##### **How It Works:**

1. **🔑 Key Generation:** S3 generates a unique data key for each object.

2. **🔄 Data Encryption:** The object data is encrypted using the generated data key.

3. **📦 Storage:** The encrypted object is stored in S3 along with the encrypted data key.

4. **🔓 Data Retrieval:** When accessing the object, S3 decrypts the data key and then decrypts the object data for the requester.

##### **Features:**

- **🔑 Key Management:** S3 manages the creation, rotation, and deletion of encryption keys.
- **📉 Minimal Overhead:** Requires no action from the customer regarding key management.
- **🔒 Data Encryption:** Each object is encrypted with a unique data key, ensuring data security.

##### **Advantages:**

- **🛠️ Ease of Use:** The least amount of customer overhead since S3 handles all encryption key management tasks.
- **🔄 Automatic Encryption:** All objects are automatically encrypted upon upload without additional configuration.

---

#### 2. **🔐 SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys)**

<div align="center" style="padding: 0 20px;">
  <img src="images/sse-kms.gif" alt="SSE-KMS">
</div>

##### **How It Works:**

1. **🔑 Key Selection:** The client specifies a KMS key (AWS-managed or customer-managed) for encryption.

2. **🔄 Data Encryption:**

   - S3 requests a data key from AWS KMS using the specified KMS key.
   - The object data is encrypted using the retrieved data key.

3. **📦 Storage:**The encrypted object and encrypted data key are stored in S3.

4. **🔓 Data Retrieval:**
   - Upon access, S3 retrieves and decrypts the data key using AWS KMS.
   - The object data is then decrypted and made available to the requester.

##### **Features:**

- **🔑 Key Management:** Utilizes AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys, which can be either AWS-managed or customer-managed.
- **📍 Regional Scope:** KMS keys must reside in the same AWS region as the S3 bucket.
- **🔍 Audit Trails:** Provides detailed audit logs of key usage through AWS CloudTrail.

##### **Advantages:**

- **🔒 Enhanced Security:** Greater control over encryption keys, including the ability to define key policies and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **📝 Compliance:** Meets stringent compliance requirements by providing detailed auditing and key management capabilities.

##### **⚠️ Potential Issues:**

- **💸 Cost:** Using SSE-KMS incurs additional charges for KMS key usage and data key requests.
- **⚡ Performance:** High usage of SSE-KMS can lead to increased request charges and may approach KMS API operation limits, potentially causing throttling.

##### **✅ Solution Using Bucket Key:**

#### 3. **🔑 SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys)**

<div align="center" style="padding: 0 20px;">
  <img src="images/sse-c.gif" alt="SSE-C">
</div>

##### **How It Works:**

1. **🔑 Key Provision:** The client provides a unique encryption key with each encryption and decryption request.

2. **🔄 Data Encryption:** S3 uses the provided key to encrypt the object data before storing it.

3. **📦 Storage:** The encrypted object is stored in S3 without retaining the encryption key.

4. **🔓 Data Retrieval:** When retrieving the object, the client must supply the same encryption key to decrypt the data.

##### **Features:**

- **🔐 Key Management:** Customers provide the encryption key with each encryption and decryption request.
- **🌐 Secure Transfer:** Must use HTTPS to protect the customer-provided encryption keys during transit.
- **📦 SDKs Only:** SSE-C can only be implemented using AWS SDKs; it is not available through the AWS Management Console.

##### **Advantages:**

- **🔒 Full Control:** Customers have complete control over the encryption keys used to secure their data.
- **🛡️ Enhanced Security:** Since S3 does not store the encryption keys, the responsibility for key management and security lies entirely with the customer.

## 🛡️ **Bucket Default Encryption**

<div align="center" style="padding: 0 20px;">
  <img src="images/default-encryption.png" alt="Default Encryption">
</div>

### **Key Points:**

- **🔧 Bucket-Level Configuration:** Applies a default encryption setting to all new objects uploaded to the bucket.

- **🔒 Automatic Encryption:**

  - **Default Encryption Types:** Choose between **SSE-S3** or **SSE-KMS**.
  - **Automatic Application:** All new objects uploaded without specific encryption settings will be encrypted using the bucket's default encryption method.

- **📝 Exceptions:**
  - **Custom Encryption Settings:** If an upload request includes its own encryption settings, the bucket's default encryption is not applied.
  - **Pre-Existing Data:** Objects that were uploaded before enabling default encryption will **not** be automatically encrypted.

### **Additional Information:**

- **🔒 S3 Glacier Encryption:**
  - **Automatic Encryption:** S3 Glacier automatically encrypts data at rest using **AES-256-bit symmetric keys** maintained by AWS.
  - **Secure Transfer:** Supports secure data transfer in-transit over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
