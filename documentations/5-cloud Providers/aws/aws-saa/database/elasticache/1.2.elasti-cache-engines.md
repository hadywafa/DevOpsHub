# ‚öôÔ∏è ElastiCache Engines

Amazon ElastiCache supports two powerful caching engines:

- **Redis:** The fastest NoSQL database, which can be used as both a database and a data store.
- **Memcached:** Purely a cache, not a database or data store.

## üóÑÔ∏è Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached

**What It Is:**

- Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system. It‚Äôs designed for simplicity and speed, used exclusively as a cache.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Distribution:** Spreads data across cluster nodes.
- **Non-Persistent:** Data is stored in memory only. If a node fails, cached data is lost.
- **No Snapshots:** Does not support creating backups.
- **No Failover/Replication:** Does not support automatic failover or replication.
- **Multi-AZ:** Nodes can be distributed across multiple Availability Zones to enhance fault tolerance.

**Ideal For:**

- Caching database query results.
- Caching data from dynamically generated webpages.
- Temporary session storage.
- High-frequency counters for rate limiting in high-traffic web applications.

## üç™ Amazon ElastiCache for Redis

**What It Is:**

- Redis is an advanced key-value store, capable of performing more complex operations and serving as both a cache and a primary data store.

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-AZ Support:** Includes a primary node and up to 5 replicas for high availability.
- **Asynchronous Replication:** Changes are asynchronously replicated to read replicas.
- **Persistence:** Supports both manual and automated snapshots (stored in S3).
- **Automated Backups:** Enabled by default, with a retention period of up to 35 days.
- **Automatic Failover:** Automatically promotes a read replica if the primary node fails.
- **Snapshot Copying:** Snapshots can be copied across AWS regions for disaster recovery.
- **Auto Scaling:** Dynamically adjusts capacity to meet demand.

**Ideal For:**

- Web and mobile applications.
- Healthcare and financial systems.
- Gaming leaderboards.
- Real-time messaging with Redis pub/sub.
- Advertising technology.
- Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.

## ‚öñÔ∏è ElastiCache vs. DynamoDB - When To Use What?

**ElastiCache (Memcached) excels at micro-second latency:**

- **Use ElastiCache ‚Äì Memcached:** For simple key-value caching.

  - Non-persistent with no durability.
  - Lacks replication and Multi-AZ read replicas.

- **Use ElastiCache ‚Äì Redis:** For key-value caching with enhanced functionality.
  - Persistent, supporting snapshots and recovery.
  - Offers Multi-AZ replication and high availability.

**Use DynamoDB:**

- For storing and indexing key-values and documents.
- Highly durable with 3x replication across Availability Zones.
- Offers single millisecond latency at any scale.
- Supports automatic scaling with zero downtime.

## üîí Secure Access & Encryption

- **Encryption In-Transit:** Both Redis and Memcached support TLS/SSL encryption (must be enabled).
- **Encryption At Rest:** Redis supports encryption using KMS keys (must be enabled).
- **IAM DB Authentication:** Not supported by ElastiCache.
- **Redis AUTH:** Clients must authenticate using a token (password) configured on the Redis server.
