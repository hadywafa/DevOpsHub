## Target Groups

A target group is a logical grouping of targets (EC2 Instances, IP addresses, or ECS microservices).

- A target is an endpoint registered with the ALB/NLB as part of a target group
- A target group is a regional construct
- IP addresses can be used to add targets that are instances in a peered VPC, on-premises servers, and any AWS resources that can be addressed by IP and port.
- ALB/NLB can route traffic to multiple target groups
- A target can be registered with a target group multiple times using different ports
