# **Network Load Balancer (NLB) Features ‚ö°**

The **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is one of the most powerful and highly efficient load balancing solutions offered by AWS, designed to handle the most demanding traffic loads. NLB provides the lowest latency and highest throughput among all AWS load balancers, making it the perfect choice for handling large-scale, high-performance applications. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into its features and understand how it can benefit your infrastructure.

## **1. High Performance and Low Latency üöÄ**

NLB is optimized for handling **high throughput** and **low latency** traffic, making it ideal for applications that require fast data transfers, such as gaming, IoT, and real-time data processing.

### **Key Points**

- NLB supports **millions of requests per second** while maintaining high throughput.
- **Low Latency**: Ensures minimal delay in processing requests, ideal for time-sensitive applications.
- **Highly scalable**: Automatically adjusts to changing workloads without manual intervention.

## **2. TCP & UDP Load Balancing üåê**

Unlike other ELBs, the **Network Load Balancer** supports both **TCP and UDP** traffic, providing flexibility for applications that use these protocols.

### **Key Points**

- **TCP Load Balancing**: Used for applications like web servers and databases that rely on TCP-based connections.
- **UDP Load Balancing**: Essential for applications such as DNS or streaming services that rely on UDP for faster, connectionless communication.
- **Same Port for TCP & UDP**: NLB can load balance both **TCP and UDP traffic** on the same port. For instance, DNS typically uses port 53, but can support both TCP and UDP traffic.

### **Example**:

- **DNS Requests**: NLB can handle DNS queries on port 53, supporting both **TCP** (for large DNS responses) and **UDP** (for typical DNS queries).

## **3. Support for IPv4 and Dual Stack üåç**

The NLB supports both **IPv4** and **dual-stack**, allowing it to handle requests from clients using both **IPv4** and **IPv6** addresses.

### **Key Points**

- **IPv4**: NLB supports traditional IPv4 addressing.
- **Dual Stack**: Allows the NLB to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, ensuring support for modern applications that require IPv6.

## **4. Elastic IP Assignment per AZ üåê**

The NLB can be assigned an **Elastic IP (EIP)** for each **enabled Availability Zone (AZ)**, providing static IP addresses for each zone, which can be used in DNS or firewall rules.

### **Key Points**

- **Static IPs**: With EIPs, you can have **static IP addresses** for your NLB that never change, which is useful for services that require a fixed IP.
- **DNS Whitelisting**: Useful when the NLB needs to be **whitelisted** by IP in external firewalls or hardcoded into DNS records.

## **5. Cross-Zone Load Balancing ‚öñÔ∏è**

By default, **cross-zone load balancing** is disabled for NLB, meaning traffic is only distributed within a single availability zone. However, you can enable cross-zone load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across multiple zones, improving fault tolerance and availability.

### **Key Points**

- **Disabled by default**: NLB does not distribute traffic across AZs unless you explicitly enable it.
- **Cross-AZ Load Balancing**: When enabled, NLB ensures traffic is distributed across all healthy targets in all AZs, improving fault tolerance.

## **6. Delete Protection üõ°Ô∏è**

**Delete Protection** ensures that an NLB cannot be accidentally deleted. This is especially useful in environments where resources need to remain stable and cannot afford downtime due to accidental deletions.

### **Key Points**

- **Prevents accidental deletion**: Ensures that NLB cannot be deleted unless this feature is manually disabled.
- **Maintains High Availability**: Helps to avoid disrupting services by ensuring the NLB is protected from accidental deletion.

## **7. Support for VPC Peering, AWS VPN, and 3rd Party VPNs üåê**

NLB supports connections from external sources, including **VPC peering**, **AWS VPNs**, and even **3rd-party VPNs**.

### **Key Points**

- **VPC Peering**: NLB can handle traffic from peered VPCs, allowing services in different VPCs to interact securely.
- **AWS VPN**: Supports AWS-managed VPNs to securely connect to on-premises infrastructure.
- **3rd Party VPNs**: You can also connect NLB to external VPNs for hybrid cloud scenarios.

## **8. ALB Behind an NLB üîÑ**

While the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** is typically used for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, it can be placed **behind an NLB** for advanced routing scenarios.

### **Key Points**

- **ALB Behind NLB**: You can place an ALB behind an NLB if you need to handle complex HTTP routing (such as path-based or host-based routing) while still benefiting from the NLB‚Äôs high performance and low latency.
- **Elastic IPs for ALB**: With NLB, you can assign **Elastic IPs** to your ALB, making it easier to manage static IPs for your services.

## **Conclusion üéØ**

The **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is an essential AWS service that excels in handling high-performance, low-latency traffic. It provides robust features such as **TCP/UDP load balancing**, **IPv4 and dual-stack support**, and **Elastic IPs** for static IP management. With features like **cross-zone load balancing** and **delete protection**, NLB ensures your applications remain highly available and fault-tolerant. Whether you're handling DNS traffic or requiring secure connections across VPCs, NLB offers the scalability, security, and flexibility needed for modern cloud applications.
