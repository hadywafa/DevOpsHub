## üîç **What are CloudFront & Lambda@Edge?**

![CloudFront with Lambda@Edge](images/cloud-front-with-lambda-at-edge.png)

- **Amazon CloudFront:** A global Content Delivery Network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users with low latency and high transfer speeds.

- **Lambda@Edge:** An extension of AWS Lambda that allows you to run code closer to users by executing functions at CloudFront edge locations. **Note:** Lambda@Edge **cannot** be used independently; it must be integrated with CloudFront.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How They Work Together**

- **CloudFront Events:** There are four key CloudFront events where Lambda@Edge functions can be triggered:

  - **Viewer Request:** When a user makes a request to CloudFront.
  - **Viewer Response:** Before CloudFront sends the response to the user.
  - **Origin Request:** When CloudFront forwards the request to the origin server.
  - **Origin Response:** When CloudFront receives the response from the origin server.

- **Lambda@Edge Functions:**

  - **Customer-Provided Code:** You supply the function code that Lambda@Edge executes.
  - **Triggered by CloudFront:** AWS runs your code based on CloudFront's configuration to manipulate requests/responses at edge locations.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Reduced Latency:** Processes data closer to users, speeding up response times.
  - **Improved User Experience:** Customizes content delivery dynamically based on user requests.

## üéØ **Use Cases**

1. **HTTP User-Agent Processing:**

   - **Action:** Analyze the HTTP User-Agent header to determine the client‚Äôs device, operating system, or browser.
   - **Benefit:** Serve optimized content tailored to specific devices or platforms.

2. **Bot Mitigation:**

   - **Action:** Implement third-party bot detection to identify and block malicious bots.
   - **Benefit:** Protect your application from automated threats and reduce unwanted traffic.

3. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - **Action:** Handle user authentication and authorization at the edge before requests reach your origin servers.
   - **Benefit:** Enhance security by ensuring only authorized users can access certain content or functionalities.
