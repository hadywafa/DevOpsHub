# RAID with EBS Volumes

`RAID : Redundant Array of Independent Disks`

- used for root volume
- it is techonlgy and not aws services
- supported in linux and windows
- increase the IOPS for an EC2 instance, we can:
  •Use EBS-optimized EC2 instances, or
  •Use a RAID array of EBS volumes. - EBS volumes support all RAID types. - RAID is performed at the OS level. - RAID volumes are not recommended to be used as root/boot volumes

## RAID Types

### RAID 0 – Disk Striping

•Stripes/writes data to all volumes.
Highest IOPS performance among
all RAID types.
•Resulting IOPS is the sum of
individual IOPS for all volumes.
•No redundancy/mirroring. Failure
of any volume means failure of
the entire array

### RAID 1: Disk Mirroring

•NO IOPS performance
enhancement. Improved fault
tolerance and data protection.
•Redundant since the same data
is written (mirrored) to all
volumes

### RAID 10 (1+0)

RAID 10 (RAID 1 + 0):
•Combines the benefits of RAID 0 and
RAID 1.
•Provides redundancy and performance
enhancements.
•Minimum four volumes. Stripes data
across mirrored pairs of EBS volumes
