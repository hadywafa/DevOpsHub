# Amazon Data Lifecycle Management (DLM)

`Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager` is a total solution for creating, deleting, and
retaining EBS volume snapshots

- You can configure snapshot lifecycle policies to carry the required EBS snapshot tasks
- A policy can snapshot a single volume or multiple volumes attached to an EC2 instance
- A DLM Policy uses resource tags to identify the volumes it needs to work on

You can also automate EBS snapshots with CloudWatch events; however, this
can be used for individual EBS volumes.
