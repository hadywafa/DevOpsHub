# Sharing EBS Snapshots

- Unencrypted snapshots can be shared with all AWS community by modifying snapshot permission to public.

- Unencrypted snapshots can also be shared with select AWS accounts (permission needs to be private)

- Encrypted snapshots canâ€™t be shared as public snapshots; rather, they can only be shared with select accounts
  - The receiving accounts must be given permissions on the KMS key used to encrypt the shared snapshot
  - An encrypted snapshot that was encrypted by the default KMS key cannot be shared
