# **EBS Snapshots üì∏**

An **EBS Snapshot** is a point-in-time copy of an EBS volume that is stored in Amazon S3. Snapshots are incremental, meaning they only store changes made since the last snapshot, helping you save on storage costs. They can be used for backup, disaster recovery, and creating new volumes in different Availability Zones (AZs) or even across AWS regions.

## **Key Features of EBS Snapshots üèÖ**

- **Stored in S3**: Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, but you do not have direct access to the bucket; they are managed through the EC2 Dashboard.
- **Region-Specific**: Snapshots are created in the region where the EBS volume resides.
- **Incremental**: The first snapshot is a full copy of the volume, and subsequent snapshots are incremental, capturing only changes made since the last snapshot.
- **Create EBS Volumes in Different AZs**: You can use snapshots to create volumes in different Availability Zones (AZs) within the same region.

- **Region Replication**: To use a snapshot in a different AWS region, you must **copy** it to the new region. Once copied, you can create EBS volumes in that region from the snapshot.

- **Snapshot Process**: While a snapshot is being taken, you can continue using the EBS volume. The snapshot operation is incremental, which means any data not written to the volume at the time of the snapshot creation will not be included.

* **Snapshot for Root and Data Volumes**: Snapshots can be taken for both root volumes and data volumes.

## **How EBS Snapshots Work üß©**

1. **First Snapshot**: The first snapshot of a volume creates a complete backup of the data on the volume.
2. **Incremental Snapshots**: After the first snapshot, only changes (deltas) from the previous snapshot are stored. This makes snapshots more efficient as they require less storage.
3. **Volume Availability**: You can still access the EBS volume while the snapshot process is ongoing.

## **Automating Snapshot Creation üîÑ**

You can automate snapshot creation using two methods:

- **Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)**: Schedule automated snapshots and set retention policies.
- **CloudWatch Events**: Use AWS CloudWatch to trigger snapshot creation based on specific events.

## **Working with Instance Store Volumes üíæ**

- **Cannot Snapshot Instance Store Volumes**: You cannot take a snapshot of an instance-store volume, but you can:
  - Backup instance-store data to **S3** as individual objects/files.
  - Copy the data to an **EBS volume**, then create a snapshot of that EBS volume.

## **Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) ‚ö°**

Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) allows for faster access to EBS volumes created from snapshots by pre-warming the volume to its full performance at creation time.

- **Faster Performance**: Normally, volumes created from snapshots are lazily loaded, meaning they don't achieve full performance until all data has been retrieved. FSR eliminates this delay, providing instant access to the full provisioned performance.

- **Enabling FSR**: FSR must be explicitly enabled for each snapshot.

  - A new snapshot created from a volume restored from a fast snapshot-enabled snapshot is **not automatically enabled** for FSR.

- **Pricing**:
  - **\$0.75** per FSR-enabled snapshot per AZ per hour.
  - **Example**: For 30 days, one snapshot enabled for FSR in **us-east-1a** would cost **\$540**.

## **Conclusion üèÅ**

EBS Snapshots are an essential tool for backup, disaster recovery, and creating new EBS volumes in different Availability Zones or regions. They are highly efficient due to their incremental nature and can be used to maintain backups of critical data. Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) makes volume creation from snapshots nearly instantaneous, ensuring high performance for applications that require low latency.
