# SQS â€“ Security & Access Management

- IAM policies are used to control who can write/read from an SQS queue.
- SQS queues also support resource-based policies (at the queue level)called Access policies.
- SQS supports encryption in-transit using TLS/HTTPS.
- SQS supports encryption at-rest using SSE with KMS keys.

---

- An SQS queue has an access policy (resource-based policy).
- The policy can determine who can read/write from the queue.
- Example Scenarios:
  - You need to allow an S3 bucket to write messages in an SQS queue when an object upload event happens.
  - You need to allow cross account access for one or more accounts to read/write messages to a queue.
  - You need to provide SQS permissions on a queue until a certain date/time.
