# SQS Additional Features

## Dead Letter Queues (DLQs)

Are SQS queues that are used by SQS to move messages that failed to process after a configurable number of receives.

### Dead Letter Queue Re-drive

We can configure a dead-letter queue redrive to move standard unconsumed messages
out of an existing dead-letter queue back to their source queues.

## Grouping Messages in FIFO Queues

Is a way to group messages in FIFO queues and ensure they are processed in order.

- It applies only to FIFO queues.
- The message group ID is specified by the message producers when they write messages.
- A message group ID indicates which message group the message belongs to.
- Messages with the same message group ID are processed in a strict order, one by one.
- Message group ID simplifies scaling consumers while processing messages in a group order

## Temporary Queues (Virtual Queues)

SQS Temporary Queue Client supports creating lightweight, automatically-deleted temporary queues, for use in common messaging patterns such as Request/Response.

- Temporary queues are lightweight communication channels for specific application threads or processes, They help save development time and deployment costs.

- The temporary queue client automatically maps these virtual/temporary queues created on demand (for a particular process or app flow) onto a single SQS queue (the host queue).
- Virtual queues have their own URLs that the producers and consumers can use to send or poll messages.
- Requests to the virtual queue URLs do not incur cost.
