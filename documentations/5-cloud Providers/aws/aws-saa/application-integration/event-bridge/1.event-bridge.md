## 🛠️ **Core Components of Amazon EventBridge**

Understanding the core components of EventBridge is essential for effectively utilizing its capabilities in your architectures.

### 🔹 **Event Bus**

An **event bus** is the central hub where events are received and routed to targets. EventBridge provides three types of event buses:

1. **Default Event Bus:** Receives events from AWS services.
2. **Partner Event Buses:** Receives events from SaaS applications integrated with EventBridge.
3. **Custom Event Buses:** Receives events from your own applications or custom event sources.

### 🔹 **Events**

Events are JSON-formatted data structures that carry information about changes or actions in your applications or AWS services. Each event contains details such as the source, type, and relevant data.

### 🔹 **Rules**

**Rules** define the criteria for matching incoming events and specify the targets to which the events should be sent. Rules can filter events based on specific attributes or patterns.

### 🔹 **Targets**

**Targets** are AWS services or resources that process the events, such as AWS Lambda functions, Step Functions, SNS topics, SQS queues, Kinesis streams, and more.

### 🔹 **Schema Registry**

The **schema registry** automatically discovers and catalogs event schemas, making it easier to integrate applications by providing a central repository of event definitions.
