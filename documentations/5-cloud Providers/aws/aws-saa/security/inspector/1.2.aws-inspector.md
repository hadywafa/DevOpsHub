## üåü **What is Vulnerability Assessment?**

A **vulnerability assessment** is the process of identifying, quantifying, and analyzing security weaknesses in your IT systems.

### Why is it important?

- Prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities.
- Minimizes risks by identifying and addressing security gaps before they cause damage.
- A recommended **best practice** for all deployed resources and applications.

## üîí **What is Amazon Inspector?**

Amazon Inspector is a **cloud-native security assessment service** designed to enhance the security of your applications and workloads in AWS.

### **Key Capabilities:**

- **Continuous Scanning**: Automatically discovers and scans EC2 instances and container images in **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** for vulnerabilities.
- **Security Insights**: Provides a detailed list of findings, prioritized by severity.
- **Integration with AWS Services**:
  - Sends findings to **EventBridge** for automation.
  - Shares findings with **Security Hub** for centralized visibility.

### **How it Works:**

- **SSM Agent**: The service relies on the **AWS Systems Manager (SSM) agent** installed in EC2 instances to collect data for analysis.
- **Application-by-Application Scans**: Scans can be configured to run for specific applications or environments.
- **Actionable Insights**: Outputs clear and actionable reports, making it easier for teams to address vulnerabilities.

## üõ† **Amazon Inspector Assessments**

### **Security Assessments:**

Amazon Inspector uses **predefined rules** created by AWS security experts to assess your environment. Assessments are categorized into two main types:

1. **Host Assessment** üñ•Ô∏è

   - Requires the Inspector agent to be installed.
   - Scans for vulnerabilities within the operating system and software on EC2 instances.
   - Data is transmitted securely over **TLS** in near real-time.

2. **Network Assessment** üåê
   - Does not require an agent.
   - Analyzes network configurations to identify misconfigurations or potential exposure.

### **Scheduling Assessments:**

- Assessments can be run **once** or scheduled **weekly** for ongoing monitoring (recommended).

## üõ° **Amazon Inspector vs. Amazon GuardDuty**

| **Service**    | **GuardDuty**                                                                                                                | **Inspector**                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | Detects attacks or threats by analyzing logs (e.g., unusual activities). It is like an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**. | Identifies vulnerabilities, ensuring no risks exist even if an attack occurs. Focuses on **detecting security gaps**. |
| **Scope**      | Analyzes account-wide activities and logs.                                                                                   | Performs host-level and network-level vulnerability assessments.                                                      |
| **Use Case**   | Best for detecting active threats and malicious activities.                                                                  | Ideal for identifying weaknesses in your environment that could be exploited.                                         |
| **Activation** | Can be enabled for a single AWS account or across multiple accounts in **AWS Organizations**.                                | Can also be enabled for a single account or across **AWS Organizations**.                                             |
