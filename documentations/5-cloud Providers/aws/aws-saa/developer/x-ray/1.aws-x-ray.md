## üåü **What is AWS X-Ray?**

**AWS X-Ray** is a tracing service that collects data about requests that your application serves, and provides tools you can use to view, filter, and gain insights into that data. This helps you understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root causes of performance issues and errors.

### üìå **Key Features:**

- **Service Graphs:** Visual representations of your application's components and their interactions.
- **Performance Insights:** Detailed metrics on latency, error rates, and request volumes.
- **Error Identification:** Pinpoint errors and bugs within your application flow.
- **Custom Analysis:** Utilize query APIs to build bespoke analysis and visualization tools.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Encrypts all traces and related data at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with AWS services like EC2, ECS, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, API Gateway, and ELB (requires an X-Ray daemon).
- **Configuration Tracking:** Works with AWS Config to monitor changes in X-Ray‚Äôs encryption settings.
