## üéØ Migration Types

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Homogeneous Migration**

- **Definition:** The source and target databases share the same engine.
- **Examples:** Oracle to Oracle, MySQL to MySQL.
- **Use Case:** Simplifies migrations by eliminating the need for schema transformation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Heterogeneous Migration**

- **Definition:** The source and target databases use different engines.
- **Examples:** Oracle to Amazon Aurora, SQL Server to Amazon DynamoDB.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for modernizing database engines or switching to AWS-native solutions.

**Heterogeneous migrations involve two key steps:**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Schema Conversion**

- Use **AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)** to:
  - Generate the target database schema if it doesn‚Äôt already exist.
  - Convert relational OLTP schemas or OLAP data warehouse schemas from one engine to another.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Migration**

- Use **AWS DMS** to transfer data to the newly converted schema, ensuring a seamless migration process.
