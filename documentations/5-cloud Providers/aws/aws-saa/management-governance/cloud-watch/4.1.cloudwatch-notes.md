# AWS CloudWatch Notes

- CloudWatch Events console is now deprecated. Use EventBridge console to create and manage event buses and rules.
- Swap space metric is not sent by default for either detailed or basic monitoring.
  - To collect swap, memory, and disk utilization, we need a CloudWatch agent installed on the EC2 instances.
