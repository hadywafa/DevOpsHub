# 🚦 AWS Service Quotas: Managing Your AWS Resource Limits

**AWS Service Quotas** allows you to centrally view and manage the limits (quotas) for the resources you can use in your AWS account. Think of it as the maximum capacity or limits on what you can launch or use within AWS.

## **Key Features:**

### 📋 **Understanding Service Quotas**

- **Maximum Resources:** Service quotas define the maximum number of resources you can use/launch in an AWS account.
- **Region-Specific Quotas:** Most quotas are specific to each AWS region, meaning the limits can vary based on where your resources are located.

### ⚙️ **Adjusting Quotas**

- **Increase or Decrease Quotas:** Some quotas can be increased upon request, while others are fixed and cannot be changed.
- **Request Process:** When requesting quota changes, AWS support may approve, deny, or partially approve your request based on their assessment.

### 🛠️ **Centralized Management**

- **Single Dashboard:** Service Quotas provides a centralized dashboard where you can view and manage all your quotas, making it easier to track and adjust as needed.
- **Integration with AWS Services:** It integrates seamlessly with various AWS services, allowing you to manage quotas across your entire AWS environment.
