# **üöÄ Introduction to Presto**

## **üìã What is Presto?**

- **Presto** is an open-source, distributed SQL query engine designed for **fast, interactive analytics** on large datasets.
- It allows you to query data from multiple sources (like HDFS, S3, MySQL, and Cassandra) using **SQL**.
- Presto is ideal for ad-hoc queries and real-time analysis.

- üí° **Key Idea:**  
  Presto is like a super-fast SQL engine that works on big data stored in multiple places without moving it.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Key Features of Presto**

1. **High-Speed Querying:**

   - Presto is optimized for low-latency SQL queries, making it faster than traditional engines like Hive.

2. **Query Multiple Data Sources:**

   - Supports querying data from HDFS, Amazon S3, relational databases, NoSQL stores, and more.

3. **Scalable:**

   - Handles petabytes of data by distributing queries across multiple nodes.

4. **Standard SQL Support:**

   - Supports common SQL commands like `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and more.

5. **Schema-on-Read:**
   - You don‚Äôt need to load data into Presto; it queries data directly where it‚Äôs stored.

## **üñß How Presto Works**

1. **Client (User):**

   - Sends SQL queries to Presto.

2. **Coordinator:**

   - Manages query execution.
   - Breaks the query into smaller tasks and assigns them to workers.

3. **Workers:**

   - Execute tasks in parallel.
   - Fetch data from the storage layer (e.g., S3, HDFS) and process it.

4. **Output:**
   - Combines results from all workers and sends them back to the client.

## **üåü Why Use Presto?**

1. **Faster Than Hive:**

   - Presto is optimized for speed and doesn‚Äôt rely on MapReduce, making it much faster for querying large datasets.

2. **Works Across Multiple Data Sources:**

   - Query data stored in S3, databases, or Hadoop without transferring it.

3. **Interactive Analytics:**

   - Perfect for ad-hoc queries where you need quick results.

4. **No Data Movement:**
   - Directly queries data where it‚Äôs stored, saving time and costs.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Key Components of Presto**

1. **Coordinator:**

   - Manages query parsing, planning, and scheduling.
   - Ensures workers execute tasks efficiently.

2. **Workers:**

   - Perform the actual data processing.
   - Fetch data from storage, process it, and return results.

3. **Connectors:**
   - Allow Presto to interact with various data sources (e.g., S3, MySQL, HDFS).

## **üîç Presto vs. Hive**

| **Feature**      | **Presto**                            | **Hive**                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Speed**        | Faster for queries.                   | Slower due to MapReduce overhead. |
| **Use Case**     | Real-time, interactive analytics.     | Batch processing and ETL jobs.    |
| **Query Engine** | Memory-based execution.               | Disk-based execution.             |
| **Ease of Use**  | SQL-like syntax, optimized for speed. | SQL-like syntax but slower.       |

## **üìä Example Use Cases for Presto**

1. **Ad-Hoc Analytics:**

   - Querying user behavior logs in real-time to identify trends.

2. **Data Lake Querying:**

   - Analyzing unstructured data stored in Amazon S3.

3. **Joining Multiple Data Sources:**

   - Joining customer data from a relational database with clickstream data stored in Hadoop.

4. **Real-Time Dashboards:**
   - Powering dashboards that need quick query execution for real-time metrics.

---

## **‚ö° Advantages of Presto**

1. **Speed:**

   - Designed for high-speed query execution.

2. **Flexibility:**

   - Works with a wide range of data sources.

3. **Scalability:**

   - Handles large datasets efficiently by distributing work across nodes.

4. **Open Source:**
   - Free to use and actively maintained by a large community.

## **üåç Real-Life Example**

**Scenario:**  
A streaming company wants to analyze customer viewing behavior. They have:

- Viewing logs stored in Amazon S3.
- Subscription details stored in MySQL.

**How Presto Helps:**

1. Queries S3 and MySQL directly without moving data.
2. Combines viewing logs with subscription details using SQL:

   ```sql
   SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_views
   FROM s3.viewing_logs
   JOIN mysql.subscriptions
   ON viewing_logs.customer_id = subscriptions.customer_id
   GROUP BY customer_id;
   ```

3. Results are available instantly for analysis.

## **üß† Simple Analogy**

Think of Presto as a **multi-tool Swiss Army knife for querying data**:

- It doesn‚Äôt care where your data is stored (S3, Hadoop, MySQL).
- It quickly gets the job done without moving the data to one place.

---

## **üåü Presto in AWS**

- Presto can be used in **AWS EMR** to query large datasets stored in Amazon S3, DynamoDB, or other data sources.
- Ideal for interactive querying and real-time analytics in the cloud.

## ü§ù Important Notes about Presto

### **Apache Hive:**

- **Use:** Querying data stored in HDFS using SQL-like syntax (HiveQL).
- **Integration:** Works on top of Hadoop, using HDFS for storage and MapReduce for processing.

### **Presto:**

- **What It Is:**
  - A distributed SQL query engine designed for fast, interactive analytic queries.
  - Created by Facebook for low-latency queries on large datasets.

### **Comparison:**

- **Presto vs. Hive:**
  - **Hive:** Primarily used for batch processing with SQL queries over HDFS.
  - **Presto:** Designed for high-speed, low-latency SQL queries across various data sources, including HDFS, S3, relational databases, and more.

### **Compatibility:**

- **Presto and Hadoop:**
  - **Integration:** Presto can query data stored in HDFS (part of Hadoop) but does not use MapReduce. It has its own execution engine.
- **Presto and Spark:**
  - **Independent:** Presto is not a component of Spark. Both can run independently or be used together for different tasks.
- **Presto and Compute Nodes:**
  - **Execution:** Presto runs on its own set of compute nodes, separate from Hadoop or Spark clusters. It‚Äôs a standalone tool designed for distributed query execution.

### **Summary:**

- **Presto is not a component of Hadoop or Spark** and runs independently on its own compute nodes.
- It‚Äôs used for fast, SQL-based querying across multiple data sources.
- While Hive is designed for batch processing on Hadoop, Presto excels in interactive, low-latency queries.
