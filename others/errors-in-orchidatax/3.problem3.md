Short answer:

* **You can ping `dev.orchida-einvoice.com`** because you‚Äôre pinging **Cloudflare‚Äôs edge IP**. Cloudflare *does* reply to ICMP.
* **You can‚Äôt ping the AWS NLB** (`‚Ä¶elb.me-central-1.amazonaws.com`) because **AWS Network Load Balancers do not implement ICMP**. Security Groups/NACLs can ‚Äúallow ICMP,‚Äù but the NLB itself doesn‚Äôt speak ping, so it will always time out.

So your results are expected:

| What you ping                                        | Who answers                           | ICMP support | Result     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| `dev.orchida-einvoice.com` (orange cloud ON)         | Cloudflare edge (e.g., 172.67.152.38) | Yes          | ‚úÖ Replies  |
| `nginx-ingress-nlb-‚Ä¶.elb.me-central-1.amazonaws.com` | AWS NLB per-AZ IPs                    | **No**       | ‚ùå Timeouts |

A few key clarifications:

* An NLB is Layer-4 for **TCP/UDP/TLS** only. There is **no such thing as an NLB ‚Äúlistener‚Äù for ICMP**‚Äîthat setting doesn‚Äôt exist. Even if your SG/NACL ‚Äúallow ICMP,‚Äù the device must implement ICMP echo; NLB does not.
* Your Cloudflare DNS record for `dev` may be a CNAME to the ELB name, but with **proxy (orange cloud) enabled**, clients resolve to **Cloudflare IPs**, not your NLB IPs. That‚Äôs why ping works for `dev`‚Äîyou‚Äôre pinging Cloudflare, not AWS.
* If you turn the cloud **grey (DNS-only)**, `dev` will resolve directly to the NLB‚Äôs IPs and **ping will time out**‚Äîexactly like pinging the ELB name‚Äîbecause NLB still doesn‚Äôt do ICMP.

### How to test properly (don‚Äôt use ping)

Use TCP/HTTP checks:

```bash
# Does the LB accept TCP on 80/443?
# (Linux) 
timeout 5 bash -c 'cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/dev.orchida-einvoice.com/80' && echo OK || echo FAIL
timeout 5 bash -c 'cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/dev.orchida-einvoice.com/443' && echo OK || echo FAIL

# HTTP(S) via Cloudflare (what users hit)
curl -I http://dev.orchida-einvoice.com
curl -I https://dev.orchida-einvoice.com

# Direct-to-origin test with correct Host/SNI (bypasses Cloudflare)
# Replace <NLB_IP> with one of the ELB IPs from nslookup
curl -I --resolve dev.orchida-einvoice.com:443:<NLB_IP> https://dev.orchida-einvoice.com
```

### If you still see Cloudflare 522

That‚Äôs **not** about ping. It means Cloudflare can‚Äôt complete a TCP connection to your origin. Check:

1. **Target group health** (correct port/path; targets healthy).
2. **Cross-zone load balancing** on the NLB (prevents ‚Äúsome IPs work, others time out‚Äù).
3. **Security Groups/NACLs** allow 80/443 **from Cloudflare IP ranges** (Cloudflare ‚Üí origin).
4. **Cloudflare SSL mode** = **Full (Strict)** if origin expects HTTPS.
5. **Ingress rules** include `host: dev.orchida-einvoice.com` (your 404 on raw ELB proves unmatched host).

Bottom line:

* Ping works for `dev` only because Cloudflare replies to ICMP.
* Ping never works for the AWS NLB. That‚Äôs by design. Use TCP/HTTP checks to validate reachability.

Perfect ‚Äî now everything makes sense. üëè
This **404 Not Found (from NGINX)** page confirms that your AWS setup is actually **working**, but your **Ingress rules are not matching** the request‚Äôs `Host` header.

Let‚Äôs decode what‚Äôs happening, why Cloudflare shows `522`, and how the 404 proves it‚Äôs a routing issue ‚Äî not a networking issue.

---

## üß© 1Ô∏è‚É£ What You‚Äôre Seeing

### ‚úÖ Direct to ELB:

You browsed to

```
nginx-ingress-nlb-8fb9a7fc7e35bf1a.elb.me-central-1.amazonaws.com
```

and got:

```
404 Not Found
nginx
```

That means:

- The AWS NLB is **reachable**.
- The **Ingress controller (nginx)** received the request.
- But there‚Äôs **no Ingress rule** matching the `Host` header:

  ```
  Host: nginx-ingress-nlb-8fb9a7fc7e35bf1a.elb.me-central-1.amazonaws.com
  ```

  ‚Üí So NGINX returned its default ‚Äú404 Not Found‚Äù.

This is **exactly expected** when you hit the NLB DNS directly instead of your intended hostname.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ What Happens via Cloudflare (dev.orchida-einvoice.com)

When you access:

```
https://dev.orchida-einvoice.com
```

Cloudflare acts as a **reverse proxy**. It sends traffic to your NLB **using the same Host header** (`Host: dev.orchida-einvoice.com`).

But now, your NLB or NGINX **is not reachable from Cloudflare‚Äôs IPs** ‚Äî leading to **Error 522** (‚ÄúCloudflare couldn‚Äôt connect to the origin‚Äù).

So we have two clear layers:

| Connection Path     | Status            | What It Proves                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| You ‚Üí NLB (raw DNS) | ‚úÖ 404 from NGINX | NLB + Ingress reachable                        |
| Cloudflare ‚Üí NLB    | ‚ùå 522 Timeout    | Cloudflare‚Äôs IPs blocked or not routed to pods |

## üîç 3Ô∏è‚É£ The Real Root Cause

Cloudflare can‚Äôt complete the TCP handshake with your NLB.

## üß† 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify in AWS Console

Go to **EC2 ‚Üí Target Groups ‚Üí [Your NLB Target Group]**

- Health Status: should be **healthy**
- Health check port/path: correct (e.g. `/` on 80)
- Cross-zone load balancing: **enabled**
- Instances/Pods reachable

Then check:
**EC2 ‚Üí Security Groups**

- Inbound: allow **TCP 80, 443** from **Cloudflare IP ranges**
- Outbound: allow all (default OK)

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Summary

| Step | Action                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Add Cloudflare IP ranges to NLB + Node SGs (TCP 80,443)             |
| 2    | Ensure Cloudflare SSL mode = ‚ÄúFull (Strict)‚Äù                        |
| 3    | Verify target group health and enable cross-zone LB                 |
| 4    | Ensure Ingress has rule for `dev.orchida-einvoice.com`              |
| 5    | (Optional) Add default backend for unmatched hosts to avoid raw 404 |

## ‚úÖ Confirmation Path

Once fixed:

```bash
curl -I https://dev.orchida-einvoice.com
```

should return something like:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
...
```

And visiting it in browser should no longer show **Error 522**.

Would you like me to show you **how your Ingress YAML** should look for `dev.orchida-einvoice.com` (including proper annotations for AWS NLB + Cloudflare SSL passthrough)?
