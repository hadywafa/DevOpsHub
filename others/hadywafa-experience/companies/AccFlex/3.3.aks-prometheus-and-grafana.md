# **‚ÄúHow did you implement an observability stack with Prometheus and Grafana on AKS?‚Äù**

I‚Äôll give you: a natural spoken answer (what you say), the concrete steps you did, key configs (snippets you can mention), and **expected follow-ups with strong answers**.
(Background: this aligns with your Hadaf role and outcomes on your CV. )

## üéôÔ∏è Transcript ‚Äî What I‚Äôd say in the interview

> **Sure.**
> On AKS, I implemented a **Kubernetes-native observability stack** using the **kube-prometheus-stack** (Prometheus Operator + Prometheus + Alertmanager + Grafana) deployed via **Helm**.
>
> I created a dedicated `monitoring` namespace, enabled **persistent storage** for Prometheus and Grafana, and configured **scrape targets** for cluster/system metrics and our **application metrics**.
>
> For apps, I exposed custom **/metrics** endpoints (we‚Äôre a .NET shop, so we used `prometheus-net`), and discovered them with **ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor** CRDs instead of static scrape configs.
>
> We added **dashboards** for: API latency, error rates, HPA behavior, node/pod health, Ingress (NGINX) metrics, and **business SLOs**.
>
> Alerts run through **Alertmanager**; we routed critical alerts to **Teams** and paging, with silence windows for maintenance.
>
> For security: Grafana is behind the cluster **Ingress** with TLS via **cert-manager/Let‚Äôs Encrypt**, and restricted by network and auth.
>
> We kept **retention** and **resource requests/limits** tuned per env (smaller in dev, larger in prod), and we stored Prometheus TSDB on **Azure Disks** via PVCs.
>
> This gave us end-to-end visibility: from **nodes ‚Üí pods ‚Üí services ‚Üí ingress ‚Üí app metrics**, with alerting, runbooks, and dashboards the team actually uses.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I actually did (ordered steps)

1. **Create monitoring namespace & deploy the stack (Helm)**

   - Chose **kube-prometheus-stack** for an opinionated, production-ready bundle.
   - `helm repo add prometheus-community ‚Ä¶` ‚Üí `helm upgrade --install kube-prometheus-stack ‚Ä¶ -n monitoring`.

2. **Persistence & sizing**

   - Enabled PVCs for Prometheus/Grafana (Azure Disk via CSI).
   - Set retention (e.g., `15d` prod / `3d` dev), TSDB chunk size, and resource requests/limits.

3. **Cluster/system metrics**

   - Node, kubelet, cAdvisor, API server, etc, are auto-discovered by the Operator.
   - Installed **kube-state-metrics** (comes with the chart) for Kubernetes object health.

4. **Application metrics**

   - Added `/metrics` in services (e.g., `.NET + prometheus-net`).
   - Labeled services/namespaces and created **ServiceMonitor** CRDs so Prometheus discovers them dynamically (no manual edits).
   - Used **Histogram** metrics for latency buckets and **Counter** for requests/errors.

5. **Ingress & TLS**

   - Exposed Grafana via **NGINX Ingress** with `hosts: grafana.company.com`.
   - **cert-manager** issues Let‚Äôs Encrypt certs into a TLS secret used by the Ingress.

6. **Dashboards & alerting**

   - Pre-loaded standard dashboards (nodes, pods, API server, HPA, NGINX Ingress).
   - Added custom team dashboards: **p95 latency**, **error rate**, **SLO burn-rate**, **queue depth**.
   - Configured **Alertmanager** routes (critical ‚Üí Teams/pager; warn ‚Üí channel), with labels for service/env/tenant.

7. **HPA visibility & autoscaling correlation**

   - Installed **metrics-server** for HPA.
   - Dashboards correlate **CPU/memory/load** with **replica counts** and **Cluster-Autoscaler** events.

8. **Security & access**

   - Restricted Grafana exposure to internal CIDRs or SSO.
   - Read-only Grafana viewers for devs; admin for SREs.
   - Prometheus serviceAccounts are least-privileged.

9. **Runbooks & SLIs/SLOs**

   - Documented **runbooks** for common alerts (what the alert means, quick checks, rollback steps).
   - Defined **SLIs** (availability, latency) and **SLOs** (e.g., 99.9%) with alerting based on **error-budget burn**.

## üßæ Key config snippets you can mention

### Helm values (kube-prometheus-stack ‚Äî essentials)

```yaml
# values-monitoring.yaml (prod-ish)
grafana:
  enabled: true
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    type: pvc
    size: 20Gi
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    ingressClassName: nginx
    hosts: ["grafana.company.com"]
    tls:
      - secretName: grafana-tls
        hosts: ["grafana.company.com"]

prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    retention: 15d
    storageSpec:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: managed-csi-premium-zonal
          accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 200Gi
    resources:
      requests: { cpu: "1", memory: "3Gi" }
      limits: { cpu: "3", memory: "6Gi" }

alertmanager:
  alertmanagerSpec:
    storage:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: managed-csi-premium-zonal
          accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
          resources:
            requests: { storage: 10Gi }
  config:
    route:
      receiver: "teams-critical"
      routes:
        - matchers: [severity="critical"]
          receiver: "teams-critical"
        - matchers: [severity="warning"]
          receiver: "teams-warning"
    receivers:
      - name: "teams-critical"
        webhook_configs:
          - url: "https://<teams-webhook-url>"
      - name: "teams-warning"
        webhook_configs:
          - url: "https://<teams-webhook-url>"
```

### App discovery (ServiceMonitor for your API)

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: api-servicemonitor
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames: ["prod"]
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-api
  endpoints:
    - port: http
      path: /metrics
      interval: 15s
      scheme: http
```

> For pod-level discovery (sidecars, daemonsets), you can use **PodMonitor** similarly.

### Ingress (Grafana with TLS)

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: grafana
  namespace: monitoring
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts: ["grafana.company.com"]
      secretName: grafana-tls
  rules:
    - host: grafana.company.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: kube-prometheus-stack-grafana
                port:
                  number: 80
```

## üîç What we measured (so you can mention concrete wins)

- **p95/p99 latency** per endpoint and per service
- **Error rates** (5xx/4xx) & top offenders
- **Resource saturation** (CPU, memory, throttling, GC)
- **HPA effectiveness** (replica changes vs load)
- **Ingress throughput** & **TLS handshake errors**
- **Node pressure** / OOMKills / restarts
- **SLO burn-rate** alerts to catch incidents early

---

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Expected follow-ups & strong answers

**Q1) Why kube-prometheus-stack vs ‚Äúplain‚Äù Prometheus?**

> It bundles Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, exporters, and the Operator with sane defaults and CRDs (ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor), which makes dynamic discovery and lifecycle management much safer and easier than hand-managing Prometheus configs.

**Q2) How do you scrape app metrics securely?**

> Services expose `/metrics` internally; discovery uses ServiceMonitor with label selectors. Access is cluster-internal, behind NetworkPolicies where needed. Grafana is exposed via TLS Ingress and SSO/limited CIDRs.

**Q3) Did you use Azure-native monitoring too?**

> Yes‚Äî**Azure Monitor/Container Insights** for platform telemetry and centralized logs; **Prometheus/Grafana** for K8s-native metrics, SLOs, and developer dashboards. They complement each other.

**Q4) How do you size Prometheus and manage retention?**

> Start conservative (e.g., 3‚Äì6Gi memory, 200Gi disk, 15d retention), then tune based on active series and scrape frequency. Record rules for expensive queries, and downsample or reduce labels where cardinailty grows.

**Q5) How do you avoid high-cardinality explosions?**

> Strict **label hygiene**: avoid user IDs/UUIDs as labels, sample histograms wisely, and use relabeling to drop noisy labels. We also add recording rules to pre-aggregate.

**Q6) What‚Äôs your alert strategy?**

> **Multi-tier**: page on user-impacting symptoms (SLO burn, 5xx spikes, no pods available); notify (but don‚Äôt page) on warnings (disk nearing capacity). Silence windows for planned maintenance; runbooks linked from alerts.

**Q7) How do you visualize autoscaling behavior?**

> Dashboards overlay **request rate/CPU/memory** with **HPA replica counts** and **Cluster-Autoscaler** events so we can see if scaling lag causes latency spikes.

**Q8) How do you persist Grafana dashboards?**

> Provision via **ConfigMaps/sidecar** or the chart‚Äôs **dashboards** values, store JSON in Git, and back Grafana with a PVC. This keeps dashboards **version-controlled** and reproducible.

**Q9) If Prometheus restarts, do you lose data?**

> No‚Äîthe TSDB is on a **PVC** (Azure Disk). We also snapshot disks periodically; for long-term metrics we can remote-write or export.

**Q10) What about log correlation?**

> Metrics in Grafana, logs in **Azure Log Analytics** (and/or Loki/ELK if needed). We include **trace IDs**/correlation IDs in logs and metrics labels to pivot across tools.

## üöÄ 20-second closing line

> ‚ÄúNet-net, we deployed **kube-prometheus-stack** on AKS with **persistent storage, secure ingress, dynamic discovery**, and **actionable dashboards/alerts** tied to our SLOs. It gave us fast incident triage, clear scaling insights, and strong developer visibility without adding a lot of operational overhead.‚Äù

If you want, I can tailor a **one-page cheat sheet** you can keep open during the interview with the exact commands (Helm install line, values keys, and kubectl snippets).
