# 🤖 “You’re certified as an Azure AI Engineer and mentioned skills like AI Agents, RAG, etc. What did you use them for? Did you build any apps?”

---

## 🎙️ Natural Spoken Answer (Realistic and Grounded)

> **Sure.**
> During my time as a full-stack developer at **Hadaf Solutions**, I didn’t work full-time in AI, but I started applying AI concepts in small but practical ways inside our main project, **TeamHub** — which is our event management platform.
>
> The platform helps clients manage **business events, exhibitions, and conferences** — including scheduling, surveys, and matching buyers with sellers.
>
> I experimented with Azure AI services and some **AI agent and RAG** ideas to improve user experience and automate manual work.

### 🧠 Simple Use Case 1 — “Smart Event Assistant” (AI Agent + RAG)

> For example, we built a **smart event assistant** prototype.
>
> - We had a lot of unstructured content — event descriptions, booth details, speaker bios, and company catalogs — stored in Azure Blob Storage and SQL.
>
> - I used an **Azure OpenAI + Azure AI Search** (RAG pattern) setup to allow attendees to ask natural questions like:
>
>   > “Who are the top suppliers in renewable energy this year?” or
>   > “Where can I find booth 23 that sells automation systems?”
>
> - Behind the scenes, I used **Azure AI Search** to index event data (documents, exhibitors, schedules) and **OpenAI GPT model** to generate conversational answers grounded in that indexed data.
>
> It wasn’t a big production system, but it was a working **proof of concept** that showed how RAG can turn static event data into an interactive assistant experience inside TeamHub.

### 🗺️ Use Case 2 — Floor Plan 3D Map (three.js + AI integration)

> Another area I worked on was the **3D floor plan map**.
>
> - I developed an interactive **three.js** app where users could view the exhibition layout, search booths, and reserve spaces.
>
> - I later added a **simple AI chat helper** that let users type:
>
>   > “Show me where Company X is located”
>   > or
>   > “Find empty booths near the main entrance.”
>
> - The chat used **Azure AI Language (Text Analytics)** for intent extraction and a small backend service that interpreted the user’s message, queried the database, and navigated the 3D map accordingly.
>
> So, it was a small but fun use of **AI + 3D visualization** to make the event navigation more natural.

---

### 📊 Use Case 3 — Survey & Feedback Insights (Azure Cognitive Services)

> After events, we collected large survey data from attendees.
> I used **Azure AI Text Analytics** to run **sentiment analysis** on free-text responses — classifying feedback into positive, neutral, and negative.
>
> That helped event managers quickly identify what attendees liked or complained about, instead of reading hundreds of survey entries manually.

## 🗣️ Expected Interview Follow-ups & Perfect Answers

**Q1: So was that a production AI system or an internal prototype?**

> It started as a **prototype** to explore AI’s potential in event management. We validated the idea, and management planned to evolve it into a premium feature. The RAG assistant and sentiment dashboards were both functional proof-of-concepts integrated with our production data.

---

**Q2: Why did you choose RAG instead of fine-tuning?**

> Because our data was dynamic — new exhibitors and sessions every week.
> RAG was **faster, cheaper, and easier to maintain**, since we just re-indexed the data in Azure AI Search instead of retraining a model.

---

**Q3: What did you learn from this AI work?**

> I learned how to connect **AI models with real business data** — not just build chatbots.
> The main lesson was: AI value comes from grounding it in **domain-specific context** like our event schedules and booth maps, rather than generic responses.

---

**Q4: How did you secure it?**

> We used **Azure API Management** to secure the AI endpoints and **Azure Entra ID (Managed Identity)** for service-to-service authentication between our backend APIs and OpenAI endpoint.

### 🎯 20-second Summary to Close Strong

> So, even though my primary role was full-stack and DevOps, I also explored practical AI use cases inside our TeamHub platform — like building a RAG-based event assistant, AI-driven survey insights, and natural-language search for the 3D floor plan.
> Those projects gave me hands-on experience connecting **Azure AI services with real business apps** — not theoretical work, but actual applied value.
