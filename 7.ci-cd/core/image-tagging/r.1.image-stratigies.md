Perfect 😎 — Let’s go through **Steve Lasker’s “Docker Tagging: Best Practices for Tagging and Versioning Docker Images”** blog (2018) in clear modern English, with a DevOps-focused explanation, emojis, and real pipeline examples.
I’ll break it into sections that match the blog’s structure — but rewritten in a way that’s practical for you today (2025).

# 🧱 1. The Core Idea — Tags Have Two Personalities

Steve starts by pointing out something that confuses many teams:

> *Tags serve two different purposes:*
>
> * **Stable tags** — easy names that change over time (e.g., `latest`, `dev`, `prod`)
> * **Unique tags** — permanent, unchanging identifiers (e.g., `git-7e4f9a1c`)

### 💡 Meaning

You need **both types** in your workflow:

* **Stable tags** tell humans “this is the current version in an environment”.
* **Unique tags** guarantee exact traceability and reproducibility.

| Type   | Example                                | Mutable? | Purpose                     |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Stable | `myapp:1.4`, `myapp:prod`, `myapp:dev` | ✅ Yes    | Easy reference, convenience |
| Unique | `myapp:git-a1b2c3d`                    | ❌ No     | Exact artifact identity     |

---

# 🏗️ 2. The Real-World Problem

Developers love using tags like `:latest` or `:dev`,
but that tag can change every time you push a new build.

Imagine this:

```bash
docker pull myapp:latest
```

You *think* you’re pulling what’s in prod… but maybe someone just rebuilt and overwrote it.

Result: ❌ No reproducibility, ❌ No rollback guarantee.

Steve’s point: tags are just **pointers**, not the actual identity.
That’s why you need **immutable identifiers** like Git SHAs or digests.

---

# 🔑 3. The Golden Rule — Build Once, Promote Many

Steve emphasizes this rule throughout the post:

> **Build the image once. Promote the same artifact across environments.**

Never rebuild separately for dev, staging, and prod — you’ll risk “environment drift”.

✅ **Good practice**

```bash
docker tag myapp:git-a1b2c3d myapp:dev
docker tag myapp:git-a1b2c3d myapp:staging
docker tag myapp:git-a1b2c3d myapp:prod
docker push myapp:dev myapp:staging myapp:prod
```

❌ **Bad practice**

```bash
# Rebuilding from source for each environment
docker build -t myapp:dev .
docker build -t myapp:prod .
```

Even if you use the same Dockerfile, timestamps, dependency versions, or build cache changes can make each image slightly different.

---

# 🔐 4. Use Immutable Tags for CI/CD Traceability

Every pipeline should push a **unique, immutable tag** — ideally derived from:

* Git commit SHA
* Build number (for legacy CI)
* Or both

For example:

```bash
myapp:git-9a8b7c6d
```

Then store or output the **digest** too:

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' myapp:git-9a8b7c6d
# contoso.azurecr.io/myapp@sha256:abc123...
```

This digest ensures the deployment always uses *exactly that artifact*.

---

# ⚙️ 5. Stable Tags = Pointers for Environments and Versions

Stable tags make it easier for humans and automation tools.

Examples Steve gives (and that we still use today):

* `:dev` → current build in development
* `:qa` → candidate image for testing
* `:prod` or `:stable` → deployed production image
* `:1.4`, `:1`, `:latest` → semantic release series

These tags **move** over time to point to the *current stable digest*, but the underlying immutable tags (`git-sha` or `build-1234`) never change.

---

# 🧩 6. Combine Unique and Stable Tags

Steve recommends tagging the same image with **both** identifiers.

Example:

```bash
docker tag myapp:git-9a8b7c6d myapp:1.4.0
docker tag myapp:git-9a8b7c6d myapp:1.4
docker tag myapp:git-9a8b7c6d myapp:stable
docker push myapp:git-9a8b7c6d myapp:1.4.0 myapp:1.4 myapp:stable
```

Now:

* DevOps can deploy by digest or immutable tag (`git-9a8b7c6d`)
* Humans and monitoring tools can refer to `:1.4` or `:stable` easily
* You can always roll back by re-deploying the older digest

# 🧮 7. Tagging Lifecycle Example (Steve’s Pattern)

Let’s map Steve’s logic into a concrete lifecycle like yours 👇

| Stage                        | Example Tag(s)                                               | Description                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| PR build                     | `myapp:pr-123` `myapp:git-a1b2c3d`                           | Temporary; used for testing |
| Merge to dev                 | `myapp:git-b2c3d4e` `myapp:dev`                              | Canonical artifact          |
| RC candidate (dev → main PR) | `myapp:git-b2c3d4e` `myapp:1.4.0-rc.1`                       | Promoted, not rebuilt       |
| Release (merged to main)     | `myapp:git-b2c3d4e` `myapp:1.4.0` `myapp:1.4` `myapp:stable` | Final promoted version      |

# 🧠 8. Why It Matters (Steve’s Key Takeaways)

| Goal         | Old Way (Anti-pattern)          | Best Practice (from blog)           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Traceability | Rebuild per env → different SHA | Single build, immutable SHA         |
| Rollback     | Rebuild old tag (can differ!)   | Redeploy old digest                 |
| Consistency  | Dev vs Prod mismatch            | One artifact promoted               |
| Automation   | Tags like `latest` cause chaos  | Explicit tagging per commit/version |
| Auditability | Hard to trace back              | Tag = commit SHA = build metadata   |

# 🚀 9. How It Fits Modern DevOps (2025 Context)

Steve’s principles aged beautifully — they’re now *standard* in mature DevOps setups (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, ArgoCD, etc.):

✅ You still:

* Build **once per commit**
* Tag with **Git SHA**
* Push with **version + environment tags**
* Deploy **by digest**

✅ Plus in 2025:

* Sign each digest with **Cosign/Notary v2**
* Attach an **SBOM** and provenance (SLSA levels)
* Store the digest in release metadata (for audit)

# 🔧 10. Small Practical Example (Modernized)

**Let’s simulate your pipeline using Steve’s method.**

| Stage                              | Command Example                                                        | Result                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Build on dev commit `9a8b7c6d`** | `docker build -t contoso/ordersvc:git-9a8b7c6d .`                      | Immutable tag               |
| **Push unique tag**                | `docker push contoso/ordersvc:git-9a8b7c6d`                            | Digest = `sha256:222bbb...` |
| **Promote to staging**             | `docker tag contoso/ordersvc:git-9a8b7c6d contoso/ordersvc:1.4.0-rc.1` | Tag added, same digest      |
| **Promote to prod**                | Add tags `1.4.0`, `1.4`, `stable`                                      | Still same digest           |
| **Deploy by digest**               | `image: contoso/ordersvc@sha256:222bbb...`                             | Guaranteed same bytes       |

# 🧾 11. TL;DR — Steve’s Docker Tagging Philosophy in One Line

> **Use two tag systems: one for traceability (immutable), one for usability (stable). Build once, promote by re-tagging, and never rebuild per environment.**

If you’d like, I can show how Steve’s model looks **visually** in your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions diagram showing build → tag → promote → deploy).
Would you like me to draw that next?
