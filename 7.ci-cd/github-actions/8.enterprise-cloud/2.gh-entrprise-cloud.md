## 🏢 GHEC Hierarchy (How Everything Fits Together)

Let’s visualize:

```mermaid

    A[Enterprise Account] --> B[Organization A]
    A --> C[Organization B]
    A --> D[Organization C]
    B --> E[Teams]
    B --> F[Repositories]
    C --> G[Repositories]
```

- You **create an Enterprise Account**.
- Inside the enterprise, you can create **one or many organizations**.
- Each organization contains:

  - Teams
  - Repositories
  - Members

Users still log in with **their personal GitHub account**, but access is controlled by enterprise-wide policies.

## 🛠️ How to Create a GitHub Enterprise Cloud Account (Step-by-Step)

## Step 1 — Go to GitHub Enterprise Signup

Visit:

➡️ **[https://github.com/enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise)**

Select **GitHub Enterprise Cloud**.

You will be asked to:

- Sign in with your **personal GitHub account**
- Provide **company name**
- Provide **billing email**
- Choose **plan** (Enterprise plan or free trial)

---

## Step 2 — Create Your Enterprise Account

You will enter:

- Enterprise Name
- Enterprise Slug (URL)
  Example:
  `https://github.com/enterprises/mycompany`

After this, GitHub creates an **Enterprise Account container**.

---

## Step 3 — Create/Link Organizations Under the Enterprise

You have two choices:

### ✔️ Option A: Create New Organization

Inside the enterprise view:

- Go to **Organizations**
- Click **New Organization**
- Choose plan (it inherits Enterprise plan)
- Assign owners

### ✔️ Option B: Add Existing Organization

If your company already has an org:

- Go to Enterprise → **Settings → Organizations → Add Organization**
- Owners of the existing org must approve the transfer.

Once added:

- Billing moves to the enterprise
- Security policies can be enforced from the top

---

## Step 4 — Configure Enterprise Authentication (SSO + SCIM)

Important for companies.

### Steps:

1. Enterprise → **Settings**
2. Select **Authentication Security**
3. Choose **SAML Single Sign-On**
4. Pick identity provider:

   - Azure AD (most common)
   - Okta
   - Ping

5. Configure SAML metadata
6. Optional: Enable **SCIM provisioning**

Now users must:

- Sign into GitHub using company credentials

Admins can block GitHub access unless the user is a member of the enterprise.

---

## Step 5 — Configure Enterprise Policies

Under:
**Enterprise → Settings → Policies**

You can control:

### Repository Policies

- Who can create repos
- Default visibility (private/public/internal)
- Allow/forbid fork
- Require branch protection

### Security Policies

- Require 2FA
- Enforce secret scanning
- Block insecure apps
- Force dependency reviews

### Billing Policies

- Actions usage controls
- Copilot seat assignment
- Packages storage

---

## Step 6 — Invite Members

Admins can:

- Invite users directly
- Add teams from SSO IdP if SCIM is enabled
- Grant **Enterprise Owner**, **Billing Manager**, or **Member** role

## 🧪 How to Use GitHub Enterprise Cloud (Daily Workflow)

Once GHEC is set up:

## 🔹 Developers Log In Using SSO

Then they get access to:

- Organizations
- Teams
- Repositories

---

## 🔹 Repositories & Collaboration Work the Same

GHEC does NOT change Git commands.

Developers still run:

```bash
git clone
git pull
git commit
git push
```

Nothing changes for them.

---

## 🔹 Organizations Enforce Policies

Admins can:

- Make all repositories **private by default**
- Require pull request reviews
- Enable Protected Branches
- Restrict who can merge
- Limit Actions usage

---

## 🔹 Enterprise-Level Audit Logging

Admins can view:

- All user logins
- Repo access events
- PR activity
- Security events
- SSH key usage

---

## 🔹 Enterprise-Wide GitHub Actions Controls

Admins can limit:

- Which actions can run (Marketplace / internal only)
- Self-hosted runner policies
- Actions minutes per organization
- Billing limits
- Required workflow approvals

---

## 📦 GitHub Advanced Security (GHEC Feature)

Enterprises can enable:

- Code scanning (SAST)
- Secret scanning (detect leaked API keys)
- Dependency scanning
- Push protection (block pushes with secrets)

This is **not included by default** — it's an add-on.
