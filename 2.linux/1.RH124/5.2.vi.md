# 📘 `vi` Editor

The `vi` editor is a **powerful terminal-based text editor** available by default on nearly all UNIX-like systems. It's lightweight, fast, and critical for system configuration when GUI tools are unavailable (e.g., in SSH).

> **Fun Fact:** `vi` stands for **Visual Interface**, and it's the basis for `vim`, which stands for **Vi IMproved**.
