# 📖 What Are Manual Pages in RHEL?

**Manual pages** (aka `man` pages) are **built-in documentation** for nearly **every command, file format, system call, config file, and API** in Linux.

Think of them as the **offline encyclopedia of Linux**, installed by default and always available, even without internet.

## 🛠️ How to Use the `man` Command

```bash
man <command>
```

### ✅ Examples:

```bash
man ls        # shows the manual for 'ls'
man grep      # shows how grep works, with all options
man 5 passwd  # shows format of /etc/passwd (section 5)
```

## 🧩 Structure of a Man Page

When you open a `man` page (e.g. `man ls`), you’ll typically see sections like:

| Section         | Meaning                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **NAME**        | Short description of the command    |
| **SYNOPSIS**    | How to use it (syntax)              |
| **DESCRIPTION** | Detailed explanation and options    |
| **OPTIONS**     | All command flags explained         |
| **EXAMPLES**    | Real use cases (not always present) |
| **SEE ALSO**    | Related commands                    |

## 🔢 Manual Sections (Categories)

Manuals are divided into numbered **sections**, each with a specific type of content:

| Section | Content Type                        | Example           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `1`     | User commands                       | `man ls`          |
| 2       | System calls (kernel)               | `man 2 open`      |
| 3       | C library functions                 | `man 3 printf`    |
| 4       | Special files (usually `/dev`)      | `man 4 null`      |
| `5`     | File formats & configuration files  | `man 5 passwd`    |
| 6       | Games (you’ll rarely use this)      | `man 6 fortune`   |
| 7       | Miscellaneous (macros, conventions) | `man 7 regex`     |
| `8`     | System admin commands               | `man 8 systemctl` |

> 💡 **Tip:** If you're not seeing the expected man page, specify the section:

```bash
man 5 passwd   # config file explanation
man 1 passwd   # user command to change password
```

## 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Navigating a `man` Page

- `↑ ↓` → Scroll up/down line by line
- `Space` → Scroll down a page
- `/keyword` → Search for text
- `n` → Next search result
- `q` → Quit

---

## 🔍 Search Command

```bash
man -K "print"
```

## 💡 Real-Life Examples

### 🔧 Want to know how to restart a service?

```bash
man systemctl
```

### 🔍 Unsure what `-r` does in `rm -rf`?

```bash
man rm
# Then search: /-r
```

### 🔧 Want to know config file format?

```bash
man 5 fstab
```

---

## 📦 Bonus: Install More Man Pages

On minimal RHEL installs, not all man pages are available.

To install missing ones:

```bash
sudo dnf install man-pages
sudo dnf install man-db
```

> 💡 **Tip:** All man pages are located in `/usr/share/man`.
