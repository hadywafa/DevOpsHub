# 🧠 Linux Variables – Complete Guide

In Linux, **variables** are used to **store values** (like strings, numbers, paths, etc.) that can be reused by shell scripts or commands. They're fundamental in shell scripting and command-line automation.

There are **two main types** of variables in Linux:

- **User-defined variables**
- **Shell (environment) variables**

---

## 🟢 1. User-Defined Variables

These are **custom variables** that **you create** during a shell session or inside scripts. They're **temporary** and exist only in the current shell session unless exported.

### 🛠️ Syntax:

```bash
variable_name=value
```

> ⚠️ No space between variable name, `=`, and value.

### ✅ Examples:

```bash
name="Hady"
greeting="Welcome to Linux"
number=42
```

### 📤 To print a variable:

```bash
echo $name
# Output: Hady
```

---

### 🚫 Common Mistakes:

```bash
name = "Hady"   # ❌ Invalid - spaces not allowed around '='
```

---

### 🧪 Temporary Nature:

```bash
name="Hady"
echo $name      # Hady
exit
echo $name      # (nothing, it's gone)
```

To **persist a variable**, you must export it or put it in a profile file.

---

### 📋 View All Defined Variables

```bash
set          # Shows all variables (local + exported)
declare -p   # Shows local variables
```

---

### 🧼 Unset a Variable

```bash
unset name
echo $name    # (No output — it's gone)
```

---

## 🌍 2. Shell (Environment) Variables

These are **predefined** or **exported variables** that are used by the **Linux system** or **shell (bash, zsh, etc.)**.

They're **global** in the sense that they can be accessed by **child processes** (subshells and scripts).

### 📦 Common Shell Variables:

| Variable   | Purpose                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `PATH`     | Tells the shell where to find commands |
| `HOME`     | User's home directory                  |
| `USER`     | Current logged-in username             |
| `SHELL`    | Current shell (`/bin/bash`, etc.)      |
| `PWD`      | Current working directory              |
| `EDITOR`   | Default text editor                    |
| `HOSTNAME` | System hostname                        |

### ✅ Example:

```bash
echo $HOME
# /home/hady

echo $PATH
# /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

## 🌐 Exporting a User Variable to Become a Shell Variable

If you want a user-defined variable to be available to child processes:

```bash
export name="Hady"
```

Now even subshells (scripts you call) will see it:

```bash
bash -c 'echo $name'
# Output: Hady
```

## 🧠 Difference Between User-Defined and Shell Variables

| Feature         | User-Defined Variable        | Shell (Environment) Variable       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Who defines it? | You                          | System or you (via `export`)       |
| Scope           | Current shell only           | Available to child processes       |
| Persistent?     | No, unless exported or saved | Usually set in login/profile files |
| Example         | `greeting="Hi"`              | `HOME=/home/hady`                  |
| Use case        | Temporary script/data values | System config, command lookup      |

## 📂 Making Variables Permanent (in `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`)

To make variables **persist across reboots**, add them to:

```bash
~/.bashrc           # for interactive non-login shells
~/.bash_profile     # for login shells
```

### Example:

```bash
export EDITOR=vim
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk
```

After editing:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## 🧪 Practice: Quick Demo

```bash
# Define user variable
greeting="Hello"
echo $greeting

# Export it as shell variable
export greeting
bash -c 'echo $greeting'  # Will work because it's exported

# View all environment variables
printenv | less

# View all variables (user + shell)
set | less
```

## 📌 Summary

| Concept                    | Description                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `variable=value`           | User-defined variable                   |
| `echo $variable`           | Retrieve the value                      |
| `export variable=value`    | Convert to shell (environment) variable |
| `env`, `printenv`, `set`   | View variables                          |
| `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` | Make variables permanent                |
