# 📂 The Most Important Linux File Commands (Your Style)

These are the _core navigation and file manipulation commands_ every engineer must know.

- `pwd` → show where you are
- `cd` → move around
- `touch` → create/update files
- `cp` → copy
- `mv` → move/rename
- `rm` → delete

Let’s go one by one 👇

## 📍 1. `pwd` — Print Working Directory

Shows your **current location** in the filesystem.

### ▶️ Command

```bash
pwd
```

### 📤 Expected Output

```text
/home/user/projects
```

### 💡 When to use?

- When you're lost
- Before running commands like `rm`, `cp`, `mv`
- Inside scripts to verify paths

---

## 📁 2. `cd` — Change Directory

Moves you from one directory to another.

---

### 🟦 Basic Usage

#### ▶️ Go to another directory

```bash
cd /home/user/projects
```

#### ▶️ Go up one level

```bash
cd ..
```

#### ▶️ Go to your home directory

```bash
cd ~
```

or simply:

```bash
cd
```

---

### 🟦 Examples + Expected Output

### 🟩 Basic Usage

#### ▶️ Create a new empty file

```bash
touch notes.txt
```

#### ▶️ Update last-modified timestamp

```bash
touch notes.txt
```

_(File already exists → timestamp updates)._

---

### 🟩 Examples + Expected Output

#### Example 1: Create multiple files

```bash
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

Output: _(No output = success)_

#### Example 2: Check timestamp update

```bash
ls -l notes.txt
```

Output:

```text
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 0 Jan 20 10:45 notes.txt
```

rm notes.txt
```

#### Example 2: Delete a directory

```bash
rm -r old_project/
```

#### Example 3: Force delete without prompt

```bash
rm -rf temp/
```

⚠️ **Be extremely careful.**  
`rm -rf /` → deletes everything (on systems that don't protect root).
Never run destructive commands unless you verify with:

```bash
pwd
ls
```
