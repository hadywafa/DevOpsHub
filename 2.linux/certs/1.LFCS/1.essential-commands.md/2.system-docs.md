# 📚 **Read and Use System Documentations**

## 📌 `--help`

> Quick help for a single command

Most (but not all) commands support:

```bash
<command> --help
```

This prints a short usage summary, common options, and exits.

### 1. Basic example: `ls --help`

**Command:**

```bash
ls --help
```

**Expected (simplified) output:**

```text
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).

  -a, --all             do not ignore entries starting with .
  -l                    use a long listing format
  -h, --human-readable  with -l, print sizes in human readable format
  -r, --reverse         reverse order while sorting
  -t                    sort by modification time, newest first
  --help                display this help and exit
  --version             output version information and exit
```

> Notes:
>
> - First lines show general usage: `ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...`
> - Then a list of options with short form (`-l`) and long form (`--all`, `--human-readable`)

### 2. Example: `mkdir --help`

**Command:**

```bash
mkdir --help
```

**Expected (simplified) output:**

```text
Usage: mkdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...
Create the DIRECTORY(ies), if they do not already exist.

  -m, --mode=MODE    set file mode (as in chmod), not a=rwx - umask
  -p, --parents      no error if existing, make parent directories as needed
  -v, --verbose      print a message for each created directory
  --help             display this help and exit
```

Use this when you just forgot the exact flag.
Example: “What was the flag for creating parent directories?” → `mkdir --help` → see `-p`.

---

### 3. Short variant: `-h`

Many tools also support:

```bash
<command> -h
```

For example:

```bash
grep -h
```

**Expected (simplified) output:**

```text
Usage: grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
Search for PATTERN in each FILE.

  -i, --ignore-case     ignore case distinctions
  -r, --recursive       read all files under each directory, recursively
  -n, --line-number     print line number with output lines
  -h, --no-filename     suppress the prefixing of file names
  --help                display this help and exit
```

Not all commands support `-h` for help, but `--help` is extremely common for GNU tools.

## 📌 `man`

> The manual pages

`man` gives you the full “manual page” for a command (or system call, config file, etc.).
Basic usage:

```bash
man <topic>
```

### 1. Example: `man ls`

**Command:**

```bash
man ls
```

This opens a text viewer (usually `less`) with the full manual.
The top of the page will look something like:

```text
LS(1)                      User Commands                      LS(1)

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List  information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
       Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.
```

### 2. Navigation inside `man`

When the man page is open:

- **↑ / ↓** or **PageUp / PageDown** → move up/down
- **Space** → next page
- **/** _text_ → search for text, e.g. `/recursive`
- **n** → next match
- **q** → quit (very important 😄)

---

### 3. Man sections (1…8 etc.)

Topics are grouped by _section numbers_. Common ones:

- `1` – User commands (things you run in shell like `ls`, `grep`)
- `2` – System calls (kernel-level, like `open`, `read`)
- `3` – C library functions
- `4` – Device files
- `5` – File formats / config files
- `8` – System admin commands

You can specify the section:

```bash
man 5 passwd   # See the /etc/passwd file format (section 5)
man 1 passwd   # See the passwd command (section 1)
```

**Command:**

```bash
man 5 passwd
```

**Expected (simplified) output start:**

```text
PASSWD(5)                  File Formats                  PASSWD(5)

NAME
       passwd - the password file

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/passwd contains one line for each user account, with
       seven fields separated by colons:
```

This is how you learn the structure of config files, not just commands.

---

### 4. Searching inside `man` output

Let’s say you want to know about `--human-readable` inside `ls`:

1. Run: `man ls`
2. Type: `/human-readable`
3. Press `n` to jump to the next match

No need to scroll forever.

---

## 📌 3. `apropos`

> Search for _which_ command you need

Sometimes you don’t know _the command name_, only what you want to do.  
That’s where `apropos` helps.

```bash
apropos <keyword>
```

It searches the names + one-line descriptions of all man pages.

---

### 1. Example: find all “compress” related commands

**Command:**

```bash
apropos compress
```

**Expected output (example):**

```text
compress (1)         - compress data
uncompress (1)       - expand compressed data
gzip (1)             - compress or expand files
bzip2 (1)            - a block-sorting file compressor
xz (1)               - general-purpose data compression tool
zcat (1)             - view compressed files
```

You see a list of commands + short descriptions. Then you can use `man` on the one you care about:

```bash
man gzip
```

---

### 2. Example: search for “copy”

**Command:**

```bash
apropos copy
```

**Expected output (example):**

```text
cp (1)               - copy files and directories
rsync (1)            - a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
install (1)          - copy files and set attributes
scp (1)              - secure copy (remote file copy program)
strcpy (3)           - copy a string
memcpy (3)           - copy a memory area
```

Now you know commands like `cp`, `rsync`, `scp` might be relevant (and functions like `strcpy` if you’re coding in C).

---

### 3. Example: search for “network”

**Command:**

```bash
apropos network
```

**Expected output (example):**

```text
ip (8)               - show / manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces
ping (8)             - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts
netstat (8)          - Print network connections, routing tables, etc.
ss (8)               - another utility to investigate sockets
ifconfig (8)         - configure network interface parameters
```

Great way to discover tools you didn’t even know existed.

---

## 🧬 How they work together in practice

Imagine this scenario:

> “I want to recursively search for text inside files, but I forgot the command name.”

### Step 1 – Use `apropos` to discover commands

```bash
apropos "search file"
```

**Possible output (example):**

```text
grep (1)             - print lines matching a pattern
fgrep (1)            - print lines matching a fixed pattern
rg (1)               - recursively search files for a pattern
```

You see `grep` and maybe `rg`.

---

### Step 2 – Use `man` for full details

```bash
man grep
```

Inside the manual, search for “recursive”:

- Type `/recursive`
- Press `n` until you find explanation around `-r` or `-R`

You’ll find something like:

```text
   -r, -R, --recursive
          Read all files under each directory, recursively.
```

---

### Step 3 – Use `--help` for quick reminder later

Next time you forget the exact flag, you don’t need the full manual; just:

```bash
grep --help
```

**Expected (simplified) output snippet:**

```text
Usage: grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
  -r, --recursive       read all files under each directory, recursively
  -i, --ignore-case     ignore case distinctions
  -n, --line-number     print line number with output lines
```

Now you can run:

```bash
grep -r "TODO" .
```

## 📋 Quick cheat sheet

```text
--help      → Quick usage & options for a known command
man         → Full documentation for a known topic/command/config
apropos     → Search for commands related to a keyword
```
