# 📘 Linux Commands to Show File Contents

These commands help you **view**, **scroll**, **slice**, and **page** through files.

We will cover:

- `cat` → Print file forward
- `tac` → Print file backward
- `head` → Show first lines
- `tail` → Show last lines
- `less` → Interactive paging (best viewer)
- `more` → Basic pager

---

## 🐱 1. `cat` — Display File Content (Forward)

**cat = concatenate and display files.**

### ▶️ Basic usage

```bash
cat file.txt
```

### 📤 Example output

```ini
Line one
Line two
Line three
```

---

### 🟦 View multiple files

```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt
```

---

### 🟦 Show line numbers

```bash
cat -n file.txt
```

Output:

```ini
     1  Line one
     2  Line two
     3  Line three
```

---

## 🙃 2. `tac` — Reverse `cat`

> **tac = cat backward**
> It prints file content **from last line to first**.

### ▶️ Basic usage

```bash
tac file.txt
```

### 📤 Example output

```ini
Line three
Line two
Line one
```

Useful when:

- Checking logs in reverse
- Reversing ordered data
- Debugging timestamped events

---

## 🔼 3. `head` — Display the First Lines of a File

### ▶️ Show first 10 lines (default)

```bash
head file.txt
```

---

### ▶️ Show first 5 lines

```bash
head -n 5 file.txt
```

### 📤 Output Example

```ini
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
```

---

### ▶️ Show first 100 bytes

```bash
head -c 100 file.txt
```

---

## 🔽 4. `tail` — Display the Last Lines of a File

### ▶️ Show last 10 lines (default)

```bash
tail file.txt
```

---

### ▶️ Show last 20 lines

```bash
tail -n 20 file.txt
```

---

### ▶️ Show last 100 bytes

```bash
tail -c 100 file.txt
```

---

### 🟨 Real Developer Use: Follow logs

The legendary:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

This shows **new lines in real-time** as the file grows.

Example output:

```ini
Jan 21 10:45:01 systemd: Starting cleanup...
Jan 21 10:45:02 kernel: USB device connected
Jan 21 10:45:03 app: User logged in
```

Press `CTRL + C` to exit.

## 📄 5. `less`

`less` is the **best way** to view large files.
It loads content **on demand**, so it's super fast.

### ▶️ Basic usage

```bash
less file.txt
```

---

### 🔥 Why less is awesome

- Can scroll up/down
- Supports searching
- Doesn’t load entire file (efficient)
- Works with logs, configs, huge files

---

### 🔹 Navigation Keys (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Key   | Action              |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| ↓ / ↑ | Scroll line         |
| Space | Scroll page down    |
| b     | Page up             |
| /text | Search forward      |
| ?text | Search backward     |
| n / N | Next/Previous match |
| g     | Go to top           |
| G     | Go to bottom        |
| q     | Quit                |

---

### ▶️ Search inside file

```bash
less file.txt
/search-term
```

---

### 📤 Example output (inside less)

```ini
Line 120: ERROR: Connection lost
Line 140: ERROR: Timeout
(press q to quit)
```

---

## 📜 6. `more`

`more` was the original pager before `less`.

### ▶️ Basic usage

```bash
more file.txt
```

---

### 🔹 Limitations of `more`

- Can’t scroll **up** (only forward)
- No advanced search
- Not great for huge files

---

### Navigation keys

| Key   | Action    |
| ----- | --------- |
| Space | Next page |
| Enter | Next line |
| q     | Quit      |

---

## 🧪 Combined Examples

### ✔ Example 1: View last 50 lines of log file

```bash
tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog
```

---

### ✔ Example 2: Scroll through a huge log

```bash
less /var/log/kern.log
```

---

### ✔ Example 3: Follow live logs + grep errors

```bash
tail -f app.log | grep "ERROR"
```

Output:

```ini
[ERROR] Database connection lost
[ERROR] Failed to retry
```

---

### ✔ Example 4: Reverse display

```bash
tac sorted.txt
```

---

### ✔ Example 5: Show first lines of multiple files

```bash
head -n 3 *.txt
```

Output:

```ini
==> a.txt <==
line1
line2
line3

==> b.txt <==
line1
line2
line3
```
