# Storage

## Overview

> Grafana Loki needs to store two different types of data: `chunks` and `indexes`.
>
> Loki receives logs in separate streams, where each stream is uniquely identified by its tenant ID and its set of labels.
>
> As log entries from a stream arrive, they are compressed as chunks and saved in the chunks store.
>
> The index stores each stream’s label set and links them to the individual chunks.
