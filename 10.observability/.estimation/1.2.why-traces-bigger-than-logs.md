# 🧠 **Why traces _seem_ bigger in some estimates**

Traces _per request_ are larger than logs _per log line_.  
But you **don’t generate a trace for every log line**.

## **One request → one trace**

(usually 10–50 spans)

### **One request → dozens or hundreds of log lines**

(depending on verbosity)

So the _per‑unit_ comparison is misleading.

## 📌 **Actual size comparison per request**

### **1. Logs**

A typical request generates:

- 5–50 log lines
- Each log line: 200–1000 bytes
- Total logs per request: **1–50 KB**

### **2. Traces**

A typical trace:

- 10–30 spans
- Each span: 1–5 KB
- Total trace size: **20–150 KB**

So **per request**, traces are indeed larger.

But…

## 📌 **Why logs dominate storage in real systems**

Because:

### **Logs = 100% of events**

You log everything.

### **Traces = sampled**

Most production systems use:

- 1% sampling
- 5% sampling
- 10% sampling (rare)
- 100% sampling only in dev or low‑traffic systems

So even though a trace is bigger than a single log line, you store **far fewer traces**.

## 📌 **Let’s compare with real numbers**

### If you have 1000 RPS:

#### **Logs**

- 1000 requests/sec
- ~10 KB logs per request
- → **10 MB/sec**
- → **864 GB/day**

#### **Traces (5% sampling)**

- 1000 RPS × 5% = 50 traces/sec
- ~50 KB per trace
- → **2.5 MB/sec**
- → **216 GB/day**

### **Logs: 864 GB/day**

### **Traces: 216 GB/day**

👉 Logs are **4× bigger**.

This is the real-world pattern.

---

## 📌 **When traces become bigger**

Traces only exceed logs when:

- Sampling = 100%
- Services are extremely chatty (many spans)
- Logs are minimal (INFO only)

This is rare in production.

---

## 📌 **The real rule of thumb**

### **Logs are 5–20× larger than traces in real production systems.**

Unless you do 100% trace sampling — which almost nobody does.

## If you want, I can compute your exact numbers

Just tell me:

- Your **RPS**
- Your **log verbosity** (INFO/DEBUG)
- Whether logs are **JSON**
- Your **trace sampling rate**
- Whether you have **Istio/Envoy access logs**

I’ll give you a precise TB/month estimate for both logs and traces.
