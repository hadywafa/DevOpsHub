Nice ‚Äî great question. Having solid books + courses will supercharge your learning. Here are my **top recommendations** (from beginner ‚Üí advanced) ‚Äî for both theory and hands-on practice.

I‚Äôll also suggest a ‚Äúlearning path‚Äù combining books + courses.

## üìö Top Books for SRE, Observability & Monitoring

Here are books I strongly recommend (with why they matter):

   ‚ÄÉ- Start the Coursera ‚ÄúMeasuring and Managing Reliability‚Äù course

2. **Deepen implementation knowledge**
   ‚ÄÉ- Read *The Site Reliability Workbook*
   ‚ÄÉ- Take a hands-on course (e.g. from KodeKloud, Udemy) involving real observability tooling

3. **Master observability**
   ‚ÄÉ- Read *Observability Engineering*
   ‚ÄÉ- Build small projects: instrument a microservice, send metrics/logs/traces, build dashboards

4. **Go deeper in systems and performance**
   ‚ÄÉ- *Systems Performance* by Brendan Gregg
   ‚ÄÉ- Study internals: OS, network, database performance

5. **Blend in advanced topics**
   ‚ÄÉ- *Building Secure and Reliable Systems*
   ‚ÄÉ- Courses or workshops on incident response, chaos engineering

6. **Continuous practice and real systems**
   ‚ÄÉ- Contribute to open-source observability tools
   ‚ÄÉ- Set up observability for your own small-scale systems or apps
   ‚ÄÉ- Read recent blog posts, conference talks (e.g. SREcon, KubeCon)

If you like, I can pick **a curated ‚Äústarter reading + course bundle‚Äù** ‚Äî a mini syllabus you can follow over, say, 3‚Äì6 months ‚Äî tailored to your pace.
Do you want me to build that for you?
