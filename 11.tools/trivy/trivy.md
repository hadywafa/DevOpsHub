# 🛡️ Trivy

> _📖 All-in-One Security Scanner for Containers, Code, and Cloud Infrastructure._

**Trivy** (by Aqua Security) is a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use **DevSecOps tool** that scans for **vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, secrets, and license issues** across your entire software supply chain — from **container images** and **Kubernetes manifests** to **IaC files**, **source code**, and **cloud resources**. It’s designed to shift security **left**, making it a strategic asset for **CI/CD pipelines**, **SRE workflows**, and **compliance automation**.

## 🧠 Architectural Overview

Trivy operates as a **modular CLI tool** or as part of a **CI/CD pipeline**, with multiple scanning modes:

| Mode                   | Target                               | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🐳 **Image Scan**      | Docker/OCI container images          | Detect OS and library vulnerabilities          |
| 📁 **Filesystem Scan** | Local directories or mounted volumes | Scan binaries, config files, and secrets       |
| 📦 **Repository Scan** | Git repositories                     | Find secrets, license issues, and misconfigs   |
| 📄 **Config Scan**     | Kubernetes, Terraform, Dockerfiles   | Detect misconfigurations and policy violations |
| ☁️ **Cloud Scan**      | AWS, GCP, Azure                      | Audit cloud resources for security risks       |

Trivy uses the **Open Vulnerability Database (OVD)**, **NVD**, and other sources to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## 📦 Key Features

- 🔍 **Vulnerability Scanning**: Detects CVEs in OS packages and application dependencies.
- 🔐 **Secrets Detection**: Finds hardcoded secrets in code, configs, and containers.
- 🧪 **Misconfiguration Checks**: Validates IaC files and Kubernetes manifests against best practices.
- 📜 **License Compliance**: Flags non-compliant or risky open-source licenses.
- ☁️ **Cloud Resource Auditing**: Scans AWS, GCP, Azure for insecure configurations.
- 🧰 **CI/CD Integration**: Works with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, etc.
- 📄 **SBOM Generation**: Creates Software Bill of Materials for supply chain transparency.
- 🧩 **Policy Engine**: Supports custom policies via Rego (OPA) or built-in rules.
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight**: Minimal setup, fast execution, and low resource usage.
- 📊 **Detailed Reports**: Severity levels, remediation guidance, and exportable formats.

## 🚀 When to Use Trivy

Trivy is ideal for:

- 🧠 **Shift-left security** in CI/CD pipelines.
- 🧰 **Container image hardening** before deployment.
- 🔐 **Secrets and config auditing** in Git repos and IaC files.
- ☁️ **Cloud posture management** for AWS, GCP, Azure.
- 📊 **Compliance workflows** requiring SBOMs and license checks.
- 🧪 **DevSecOps enablement** across teams and environments.

It’s especially powerful when embedded early in the pipeline — catching issues before they reach production.
