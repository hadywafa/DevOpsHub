# **JumpBox** and a **Bastion Host**

a **JumpBox** and a **Bastion Host** are similar in concept, but they serve slightly different purposes:

## **Bastion Host**

- **Definition**: A Bastion Host is a server that is exposed to the public internet and acts as a secure gateway to access a private network.
- **Purpose**: It provides a controlled entry point to the internal network, minimizing the attack surface and enhancing security.
- **Usage**: Commonly used to manage servers and devices in a private network from an external network, such as the internet.

## **JumpBox**

- **Definition**: A JumpBox is a hardened server used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone.
- **Purpose**: It acts as a bridge between different security zones, providing a single point of entry to manage systems in a secure manner.
- **Usage**: Often used within an organization's internal network to manage devices in different security zones, such as a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone).

In summary, both JumpBoxes and Bastion Hosts provide secure access to internal networks, but Bastion Hosts are typically used for external access, while JumpBoxes are used for internal network management.
