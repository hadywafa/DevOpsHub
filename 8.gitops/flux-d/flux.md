# 🌊 Flux

> _📖 GitOps-native Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes, built for scale and modularity._

**Flux** is a CNCF-graduated, open-source GitOps tool that automates **Kubernetes deployments** by continuously reconciling your cluster state with the desired state stored in Git. Unlike monolithic CD tools, Flux is built as a **modular set of Kubernetes controllers**, making it ideal for **microservice-heavy, multi-cluster environments** where security, scalability, and automation are paramount.

---

## 🧠 Architectural Overview

Flux is powered by the **GitOps Toolkit**, a collection of Kubernetes-native controllers:

| Component                                       | Role                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📁 **Source Controller**                        | Pulls artifacts from Git, Helm repos, OCI registries, S3 buckets. |
| 🧩 **Kustomize Controller**                     | Applies Kustomize overlays to Kubernetes manifests.               |
| 🎛️ **Helm Controller**                          | Manages Helm chart lifecycles.                                    |
| 🔔 **Notification Controller**                  | Sends alerts to Slack, MS Teams, etc., and handles webhooks.      |
| 🧬 **Image Reflector & Automation Controllers** | Detect new container images and auto-update manifests in Git.     |
| 🧰 **Flux CLI**                                 | Bootstraps and manages Flux components.                           |

Flux runs **inside your cluster**, and uses **pull-based reconciliation** to ensure your live state matches Git — no manual `kubectl` or CI triggers needed.

## 🚀 When to Use Flux

Flux is ideal for:

- 🧠 **Microservice-heavy environments** with many Git repos and teams.
- 🔐 **Security-conscious setups** needing encrypted secrets and RBAC.
- 🧰 **Multi-cluster orchestration** with Git as the control plane.
- 🧪 **Immutable infrastructure** with Git-tracked rollbacks and auditability.
- 🧱 **Cloud-native CD pipelines** that need modular, scalable GitOps tooling.

## ⚔️ Flux vs Argo CD: Strategic Comparison

| Feature                | 🌊 **Flux**                           | 🚀 **Argo CD**                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Architecture           | Modular (controller-per-function)     | Monolithic (single binary)              |
| UI Dashboard           | ❌ None (optional via Weave GitOps)   | ✅ Rich Web UI                          |
| Sync Strategy          | ✅ Auto only (reconciliation loop)    | ✅ Manual & Auto                        |
| Drift Detection        | ✅ Periodic reconciliation            | ✅ Real-time with visual feedback       |

| GitOps Ecosystem       | Flux Core + Flagger + GitOps Toolkit  | Argo CD + Rollouts + Workflows + Events |

**TL;DR**:

- Use **Flux** for **modular, secure, scalable GitOps** across clusters.
- Use **Argo CD** for **visual GitOps onboarding** and centralized app management.
