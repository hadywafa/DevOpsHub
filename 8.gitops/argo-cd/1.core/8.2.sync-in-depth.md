# 🔄️ **Next topic to study**

## 🥇 **1. Sync Waves + Hooks (TOP PRIORITY)**

### Why?

Because **real production GitOps deployments** _always_ need custom ordering:

- Install CRDs before CRs
- Migrate DB before rolling out app
- Restart pods after config change
- Pause traffic before deploy
- Cleanup jobs

**Hooks + sync waves** give you these controls.

### Study items:

- PreSync vs Sync vs PostSync vs SyncFail
- hook-delete-policy
- ordering with `sync-wave`
- using hooks in Helm chart manifests
- how hooks behave on failure

### Example practical scenarios:

- Run database migration job before deploying backend
- Deploy cert-manager CRDs first
- Perform canary check with PostSync job

---

## 🥈 **2. Sync Options (THE MOST CONFUSING PART)**

Especially:

- `CreateNamespace=true`
- `ServerSideApply=true`
- `ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=true`
- `PruneLast=true`
- `RespectIgnoreDifferences=true`
- `Replace=true` (dangerous!)

### Why?

Because these options **change how Argo CD applies resources**, and if you misuse them, deployments break or drift happens.

### Focus especially on:

- **Replace=true** → can delete & recreate Deployments (downtime!)
- **ServerSideApply=true** → must for huge charts (Prometheus, Istio)
- **SkipPrune** vs **Prune=true** → drift control
- **ApplyOutOfSyncOnly** → improves CI speed

---

## 🥉 **3. Sync Modes (Auto Sync vs Manual Sync)**

This is simple but incredibly important for real GitOps workflows.

### Learn:

- auto-sync lifecycle
- sync retries
- prune behavior
- self-heal behavior
- why `selfHeal=true` is critical in zero-drift teams

---

## 🟦 **4. Apply vs Replace Strategy (CRITICAL for production)**

### Why?

Because Apply vs Replace is the difference between:

- **safe rolling updates** vs
- **delete and recreate** (downtime!)

You must know:

- When Apply breaks (immutable fields)
- When Replace is needed (CRDs, cert-manager resources)
- Why Replace cannot be used on Deployments

---

## 🟩 **5. Reconciliation Loop + Webhooks**

This is essential to understand:

- How Argo CD detects changes
- Why it takes X seconds to sync
- Why GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps should trigger sync
- How to force immediate sync via API
- Why Argo CD is not meant to poll infinitely fast

---

## 🟧 **6. Skip Options (SkipSync, SkipPrune, etc.)**

Good to know but used rarely.

Examples:

- skip syncing CRDs
- skip pruning shared resources (e.g., AWS LB controller)
- skip changes in ConfigMap only during diff

---

## 🟨 **7. Advanced: Backoff, retry.failures, sync windows**

These are helpful in large enterprises.

- Prevent syncs during business hours
- Allow sync only during maintenance windows
- Retry failed syncs
- Backoff delay patterns

---

## 🟫 **8. Least important (but still useful)**

- Validate=false
- FailOnSharedResource
- IgnoreDifferences
- Auto-create namespace

---

## 🎯 **What YOU Should Learn Next (Personal Advice)**

Based on your questions and your GitOps level so far,
**I recommend this exact learning order**:

---

### 🔥 **1. Sync Options (Replace, SSA, Prune, etc.)**

Because you are deploying real workloads ― these options matter right now.

---

### 🔥 **2. Sync Waves + Hooks**

Because this is used in 100% of non-trivial platforms.

---

### 🔥 **3. Reconciliation Loop + Webhooks**

Because you want fast deployments triggered from CI.

---

### 🔥 **4. Auto-sync features (prune & self-heal)**

Because this affects how safe/unsafe your GitOps workflow is.

---

### 🔥 **5. Replace Strategy vs Apply Strategy**

Because downtime can happen if you misconfigure it.

---

When you finish these 5 topics, **you will be better than 80% of DevOps engineers using Argo CD**.
