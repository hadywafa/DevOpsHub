Below is the **exact solution** you must implement in a Kubernetes cluster to satisfy ALL requirements in this auditing question (Weight 20).
This is the **correct K8s audit policy configuration, log retention setup, and kube-apiserver changes**.

---

# ✅ **Step 1 — Enable Auditing Using `/etc/kubernetes/cluster-policy.yaml`**

Make sure the kube-apiserver is launched with audit flags:

Edit its systemd manifest:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
```

Add or modify these flags:

```yaml
- --audit-log-path=/var/log/cluster-audit.log
- --audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/cluster-policy.yaml
- --audit-log-maxage=10
- --audit-log-maxsize=10
- --audit-log-maxbackup=3
```

Meaning:

| Requirement                                | Setting                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Store logs at `/var/log/cluster-audit.log` | `--audit-log-path`        |
| Retain logs for **10 days**                | `--audit-log-maxage=10`   |
| Each log max size **10MB**                 | `--audit-log-maxsize=10`  |
| Keep max **3 files**                       | `--audit-log-maxbackup=3` |

Restart is automatic because this is a static pod.

---

# ✅ **Step 2 — Update the Audit Policy File (`cluster-policy.yaml`)**

Now edit:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/kubernetes/cluster-policy.yaml
```

Use the following **correct audit policy** that meets all rules:

```yaml
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:

  # 1️⃣ Track delete activity on secrets in kube-system at Metadata level
  - level: Metadata
    resources:
    - group: ""
      resources: ["secrets"]
    namespaces: ["kube-system"]
    verbs: ["delete"]

  # 2️⃣ Track changes to deployments in default namespace at Request level
  - level: Request
    resources:
    - group: "apps"
      resources: ["deployments"]
    namespaces: ["default"]

  # 3️⃣ Track all other requests at Metadata level (catch-all)
  - level: Metadata
    resources:
    - group: ""
      resources: ["*"]
    - group: "apps"
      resources: ["*"]
```

This satisfies:

✔ Delete secrets in `kube-system` → Metadata
✔ Deployment changes in `default` → Request
✔ "All other requests" → Metadata

---

# ✅ **Step 3 — Ensure Policy Takes Effect**

After modifying any file under `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`, kubelet automatically restarts the kube-apiserver.

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep kube-apiserver
```

Check audit log is created:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/cluster-audit.log
```

You should see JSON events coming in.

---

# ✅ **Step 4 — Validate All Requirements Are Met**

### ✔ Logs go to `/var/log/cluster-audit.log`

### ✔ Retain logs for **10 days**

### ✔ Max single file size = **10MB**

### ✔ Max **3 rotated files**

### ✔ Delete events on `secrets` in `kube-system` logged at **Metadata level**

### ✔ Deployment changes in `default` logged at **Request level**

### ✔ All other requests logged at **Metadata level**

### ✔ Configuration persists across restarts

# ⭐ **Final Exam-Ready Response**

> **Auditing is enabled using `/etc/kubernetes/cluster-policy.yaml`, logs are stored at `/var/log/cluster-audit.log` with 10-day retention, 10MB max size, and 3-file rotation. The audit policy has been updated to record delete actions on `secrets` in `kube-system` (Metadata level), record deployment changes in `default` (Request level), and log all other requests at Metadata level. The policy is applied and active.**
