## üß© What Are Special Interest Groups (SIGs)?

### üîπ Definition

**Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** are **community-driven working groups** under the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**.
They bring together experts, contributors, and users who share a **common technical or domain interest** (like security, networking, or observability) ‚Äî to collaborate, discuss best practices, and improve the cloud-native ecosystem.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Purpose of SIGs

| Purpose                       | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collaboration**             | Allow developers and operators to share knowledge and experiences on specific areas of Kubernetes or other CNCF projects. |
| **Guidance**                  | Define standards, patterns, and recommendations for the broader cloud-native community.                                   |
| **Feedback Loop**             | Provide feedback from real-world use cases back to CNCF technical oversight.                                              |
| **Documentation & Education** | Produce whitepapers, tutorials, and reference architectures.                                                              |

## üß† CNCF SIG Structure

Each **SIG** has:

* **Chairs and Technical Leads** ‚Äî coordinate meetings and agendas
* **Members** ‚Äî open to anyone interested in contributing
* **Public communication** ‚Äî Slack channels, GitHub repos, and regular meetings

## üåê Examples of CNCF SIGs

| SIG Name              | Focus Area                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SIG Security**      | Cloud-native security practices, threat models, and security tools |
| **SIG Network**       | Networking in Kubernetes and other CNCF projects                   |
| **SIG Observability** | Monitoring, metrics, logging, tracing                              |
| **SIG Storage**       | Persistent storage patterns and standards                          |
| **SIG Runtime**       | Container runtimes (containerd, CRI-O, runc) and sandboxing        |
| **SIG App Delivery**  | Application packaging, CI/CD, Helm, and GitOps                     |

## üß≠ Difference Between CNCF SIGs and Kubernetes SIGs

| Aspect      | CNCF SIGs                                             | Kubernetes SIGs                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**   | Entire CNCF ecosystem (Kubernetes + other projects)   | Kubernetes project itself                       |
| **Goal**    | Broader cloud-native topics (security, runtime, etc.) | Improve and maintain Kubernetes core components |
| **Example** | CNCF SIG Security                                     | Kubernetes SIG Node                             |

## ‚úÖ Summary (Exam Hint)

> **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** are community-driven teams within CNCF that focus on specific technical or functional areas (e.g., Security, Networking, Observability) to enhance collaboration, share best practices, and guide project development.
