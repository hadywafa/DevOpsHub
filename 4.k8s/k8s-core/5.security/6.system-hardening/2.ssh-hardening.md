# 🚨 **SSH Hardening**

**SSH hardening is the process of securing your SSH server to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, and exploitation. It involves configuring the SSH daemon (`sshd`) with strict authentication, access control, and logging policies.**

Here’s a modular breakdown from basic to advanced:

---

## ✅ **Disable Password Auth**

Prefer key-based authentication:

```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# PasswordAuthentication no
```

## 📜 **Use cryptography Auth**

SSH is more secure using cryptography than password

_Example For Making hady access Islam Device using SSH:_

```bash
# Step 1 -> Generate a key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Step 2 -> Copy the public key to the server (using password authentication)
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub islam@89.0.142.86

# Step 3 -> Connect to the server
ssh islam@89.0.142.86

cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
