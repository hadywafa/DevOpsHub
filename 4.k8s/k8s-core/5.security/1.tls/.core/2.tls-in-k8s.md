# 🔐 TLS Types in Kubernetes: Full Overview

**In Kubernetes, TLS is used in three major contexts: (1) internal control plane communication, (2) external traffic entry (Ingress/Gateway), and (3) workload-to-workload encryption. Each has distinct tooling, certificate flows, and trust models.**

Here’s a full breakdown of TLS types in Kubernetes, structured for onboarding and clarity:

---

## 1. **Control Plane TLS (`tls-cluster`)**

> Secures communication between Kubernetes components like kube-apiserver, kubelet, etcd, and controller-manager.

### 🔧 Tools & Mechanisms

- **Certificate Generation**: `kubeadm`, `cfssl`, `Easy-RSA`
- **Storage**: `/etc/kubernetes/pki/`
- **Authentication**: Mutual TLS (mTLS) between components
- **Used In**:
  - kubeconfig files
  - kubelet registration
  - etcd client/server communication
  - Admission webhooks

### 🧠 Purpose

- Prevent MITM attacks inside the cluster
- Authenticate control plane components
- Secure sensitive internal traffic

---

## 2. **Ingress/Gateway TLS (`tls-external`)**

> Secures external traffic entering the cluster via Ingress controllers or Gateway API.

### 🔧 Tools & Mechanisms

- **Ingress Controller**: NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy
- **Gateway API**: HTTPRoute, TLSRoute
- **Certificate Management**: `cert-manager`, manual secrets
- **TLS Secret**:

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret tls my-tls --cert=cert.crt --key=cert.key
  ```

- **Ingress Resource**:

  ```yaml
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - app.example.com
      secretName: my-tls
  ```

### 🧠 Purpose

- Encrypt traffic from clients (e.g., browsers)
- Terminate TLS at the edge
- Route decrypted traffic to internal services

---

## 3. **Workload-to-Workload TLS (`tls-workload`)**

> Encrypts traffic between Pods or services inside the cluster, often using mTLS.

### 🔧 Tools & Mechanisms

- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd (automatic mTLS)
- **Identity Frameworks**: SPIRE/SPIFFE
- **Custom TLS**: Apps using HTTPS/gRPC with their own certs
- **Webhook TLS**: Admission webhooks require TLS certs signed by the cluster CA

### 🧠 Purpose

- Secure service-to-service communication
- Enforce identity and trust boundaries
- Enable zero-trust networking inside the cluster

## 🧩 Comparison Table

| TLS Type       | Scope                          | Tooling Used                        | Certificate Source         | Trust Model             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `tls-cluster`  | Control plane & internal infra | kubeadm, cfssl, Easy-RSA            | Static certs in `/pki`     | mTLS between components |
| `tls-external` | External traffic entry         | Ingress, Gateway API, cert-manager  | TLS secrets, Let's Encrypt | TLS termination         |
| `tls-workload` | Pod-to-Pod communication       | Istio, Linkerd, SPIRE, custom HTTPS | Mesh CA or app-generated   | mTLS or app TLS         |

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Use `tls-cluster`** to secure Kubernetes internals like kubelet ↔ API server.
- **Use `tls-external`** to secure external traffic via Ingress or Gateway.
- **Use `tls-workload`** to secure service-to-service traffic inside the cluster.

Each type has its own certificate lifecycle, tooling, and security implications. Keeping them separate in your documentation helps clarify onboarding, troubleshooting, and compliance.
