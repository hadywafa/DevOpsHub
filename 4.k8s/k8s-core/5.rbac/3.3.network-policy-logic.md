# ‚ÅâÔ∏è **Kubernetes NetworkPolicy Behavior**

**In Kubernetes NetworkPolicy, the `from:` list under `ingress:` uses logical OR between entries ‚Äî each item is an independent source that is allowed.**

---

## üß† How `from:` Works in `ingress`

When you define multiple entries under `from:`, Kubernetes interprets them as **separate allowed sources**. Traffic is allowed if **any one** of the conditions matches.

### ‚úÖ Your Example:

```yaml
ingress:
  - from:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
          except:
            - 172.17.1.0/24
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            project: myproject
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            role: frontend
```

This means:

- Allow traffic from IPs in `172.17.0.0/16` **except** `172.17.1.0/24`
- OR from any pod in a namespace labeled `project=myproject`
- OR from any pod labeled `role=frontend` in the same namespace

**Each entry is evaluated independently. If any one matches, traffic is allowed.**

---

## üîç Can You Use AND Logic?

Yes ‚Äî but only by **nesting selectors**. For example, to allow traffic **only from pods with `role=frontend` in namespaces labeled `project=myproject`**, you must combine both selectors:

```yaml
from:
  - namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        project: myproject
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        role: frontend
```

This entry uses **AND logic**: both the namespace and pod labels must match.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Apply AND Logic in `ingress.from`

To require:

- IP must be in `172.17.0.0/16` (excluding `172.17.1.0/24`)
- Namespace must have label `project=myproject`
- Pod must have label `role=frontend`

You must **nest all three selectors inside one `from:` entry**:

```yaml
ingress:
  - from:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
          except:
            - 172.17.1.0/24
        namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            project: myproject
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            role: frontend
```

This structure enforces:

- Traffic is allowed **only** if the source pod:
  - Is in a namespace labeled `project=myproject`
  - Has label `role=frontend`
  - Comes from an IP in the allowed CIDR range

---

## üß† Behind the Scenes

Kubernetes treats each `from:` item as a **logical OR** unless you **combine selectors** inside a single item. When you include `namespaceSelector`, `podSelector`, and `ipBlock` together, it becomes **logical AND** ‚Äî all must match.

## üß© Summary

| Structure                                                 | Logic Used |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Multiple entries under `from:`                            | **OR**     |
| Combined `namespaceSelector` + `podSelector` in one entry | **AND**    |
